A week earlier, the queen, who is 90, missed a Christmas Day church service, for the first time since 1988, because of the illness. “The Queen does not yet feel ready to attend church as she is still recuperating from a heavy cold,” the palace said in a statement. The queen’s husband, Prince Philip, who had also been ill, was well enough to attend both services, in the church at Sandringham, which is in Norfolk, on the east coast of England. The queen, who ascended to the throne in 1952, became the world’s   monarch following the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand in October.

The Islamic State later claimed responsibility for the attack. The bomb went off in a produce market that was packed with day laborers, a police officer said, adding that another 52 people were wounded. During a news conference with Mr. Hollande, Haider   Iraq’s prime minister, said the suicide bomber had pretended to be a man seeking to hire day laborers. Once the workers gathered around, he detonated the vehicle. The Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, claimed the attack in a statement circulated on a website that is often used by the group. It was the third such attack in three days in or near Baghdad, underscoring the lingering threat posed by the extremist group despite a string of setbacks for it elsewhere in the country over the past year, including in and around the northern city of Mosul. The attack took place in Sadr City, a vast Shiite district in eastern Baghdad that has been repeatedly targeted by Sunni extremists since the 2003   invasion. Militiamen loyal to the Shiite cleric Moktada   were seen evacuating bodies in their trucks before ambulances arrived. Bodies were scattered across the bloody pavement alongside fruit, vegetables and laborers’ shovels and axes. A minibus filled with dead passengers was on fire. Asaad Hashim, 28, an owner of a nearby cellphone store, described how the laborers had pushed and shoved around the bomber’s vehicle, trying to get hired. “Then a big boom came, sending them up into the air,” said Mr. Hashim, who suffered shrapnel wounds to his right hand. He blamed “the most ineffective security forces in the world” for failing to prevent the attack. An angry crowd cursed the government, even after a representative of Mr. Sadr tried to calm them. Late last month, the Iraqi authorities started removing some of the security checkpoints in Baghdad in a bid to ease traffic for the capital’s six million residents. “We have no idea who will kill at any moment and who’s supposed to protect us,” said Ali Abbas, a    father of four who was hurled over his vegetable stand by the blast. “If the securities forces can’t protect us, then allow us to do the job. ” Several smaller bombings elsewhere in the city on Monday killed at least 20 civilians and wounded at least 70, according to medics and police officials. All officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to reporters. The United States State Department condemned the attacks. Separately, the American military announced on Monday the death of a coalition service member in Iraq in a “  incident,” without providing further details. Mr. Hollande met with Mr. Abadi and President Fuad Masum, and later traveled to the   northern Kurdish region to meet with French troops and local officials. He pledged to help displaced Iraqis return to Mosul, where Iraqi forces are waging a large offensive against the Islamic State. France is part of the   coalition formed in 2014 to fight the Islamic State after the extremist group seized large areas in Iraq and neighboring Syria. France has suffered multiple attacks claimed by the extremist group.');

The trouble continued when she gave up on another of her   numbers, “We Belong Together,” while a recording of the song continued to play, a confirmation that she had been  . But on Sunday, a dispute erupted between Ms. Carey’s representatives and producers of ABC’s “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve With Ryan Seacrest,” on which the singer was performing. Ms. Carey’s manager, Stella Bulochnikov, charged that the show’s producers had been aware of technical problems but did not fix them  —   and chose to continue showing Ms. Carey’s messy performance “to get ratings. ” “I will never know the truth, but I do know that we told them three times that her mike pack was not working and it was a disastrous production,” Ms. Bulochnikov told Us Weekly magazine on Sunday. “I’m certainly not calling the F. B. I. to investigate. It is what it is: New Year’s Eve in Times Square. Mariah did them a favor. She was the biggest star there, and they did not have their” act together. Dick Clark Productions, which produced the show, issued a statement on Sunday night saying that Ms. Carey’s performance woes had nothing to do with the production, and that any suggestion that the company “would ever intentionally compromise the success of any artist is defamatory, outrageous and frankly absurd. ” “In very rare instances, there are of course technical errors that can occur with live television,” the statement said, adding that an initial investigation suggested that the production company “had no involvement in the challenges associated with Ms. Carey’s New Year’s Eve performance. ” A veteran audio producer, Robert Goldstein of Maryland Sound International, a company that has worked on the Times Square event for years, also said in an email that there had been no malfunctions with the sound equipment he oversaw. “Every monitor and   device worked perfectly,” Mr. Goldstein said. “ I can’t comment beyond that and don’t know what her nontechnical issue may have been. ” A spokeswoman for Ms. Carey said on Sunday that the singer was not at fault for her performance. “Unfortunately there was nothing she could do to continue with the performance given the circumstances,” the spokeswoman, Nicole Perna, told The Associated Press. It was a rare meltdown on national television by one of the   recording artists of all time. Ms. Carey, a pop phenomenon in the 1990s who won five Grammys out of 34 nominations over the years, was the final   act on ABC’s “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve With Ryan Seacrest. ” She had just finished “Auld Lang Syne” when her star turn began to spiral out of control. “We can’t hear,” she said in the opening seconds of “Emotions” after she sashayed down the stage before more than one million people who had gathered to watch the ball drop in Manhattan. Standing still with her left hand on her hip while music played, Ms. Carey told the audience that there had not been a proper sound check before her performance. Then she said, “We’ll just sing,” and noted proudly of her song, “It went to No. 1. ” But she could not manage the notes that followed, and she either forgot lyrics or did not want to deliver a subpar performance. “We’re missing some of these vocals, but it is what it is,” she said. “Let the audience sing. ” ABC quickly cut to shots of the Times Square crowd as Ms. Carey tried to perform some of her choreography. She continued suggesting fixes from the stage, and at one point seemed to defend herself. “I’m trying to be a good sport here,” she said. When the number ended, the crowd cheered her on. “That was  —   ” she said, pausing for effect, “amazing. ” She seemed to recover at first with “We Belong Together,” but there appeared to be another malfunction, and Ms. Carey again stopped singing. But this time, the prerecorded number kept playing. “It just don’t get any better,” she said, and then left the stage. The cause of the problem was not immediately clear. After the performance, Ms. Carey posted a mildly profane slang phrase on Twitter with an “upset” emoji, then wrote: “Have a happy and healthy new year everybody! Here’s to making more headlines in 2017. ” An ABC spokesman said on Sunday that the network would not comment on the problems with Ms. Carey’s performance.');

House Republicans, on the verge of a Washington takeover as the new Congress convened Tuesday, couldn’t stop themselves from trying to dilute the power of a despised ethics watchdog as their first order of business. In the process, they created an unsightly spectacle that pretty much ruined an   celebration of unified Republican government, undermined their own leadership and perhaps foretold the shape of things to come. House Republicans take a stand on a contentious issue, Donald J. Trump turns to Twitter to break with House Republicans, then Republicans frantically reverse course. “Mr. Trump campaigned that he was going to drain the swamp, and here we are on Day 1 trying to fill the swamp,” Representative Walter B. Jones, Republican of North Carolina, said after he and his colleagues hurriedly jettisoned a plan seen as a brazen attempt to weaken an independent ethics office that some felt had been unfair to lawmakers. “That is not a good way to start. ” Deluged by angry phone calls and bad headlines, chagrined Republican officials say they were well on their way to abandoning the ethics revisions adopted Monday night in a   party meeting before Mr. Trump weighed in via Twitter and suggested that the overhaul shouldn’t be a top priority, urging Republicans to focus instead on taxes and health care. But the final decision did come after the  ’s Twitter posts, underscoring his sway over House Republicans who had moved ahead despite objections and warnings about the optics of the change from Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader. House Republicans might have amusedly applauded Mr. Trump’s cutting tweets when they were aimed at the news media and other common foes, but they found them measurably less funny when the criticisms were directed their way, raising alarms among Republicans about his power to corral them via social media. Following the decision to reverse course, several lawmakers were quietly fretting that Mr. Trump’s megaphone was much more powerful than they had realized. Other Republicans both on and off Capitol Hill were wondering how the   proposal got as far as it did, given the stated reservations of Mr. Ryan and Mr. McCarthy among others. They said it did not bode well that the rank and file was so willing to ignore leadership on such a potentially critical matter, demonstrating once again how hard it can be to manage the House Republicans even when the party is set to control both Capitol Hill and the White House. Mr. Ryan had already headed off an earlier rules change that was deemed potentially embarrassing: a proposal to let lawmakers resume funding of pet projects through designated “earmarks” as long as the money went to public entities. Abuse of earmarks was one of the main sources of congressional corruption that led to tighter ethics rules and a ban on such spending, and Mr. Ryan and his allies believed that a quick move to restore them so soon after Mr. Trump’s election would not send the proper signal. But Mr. Ryan has promised to revisit both the earmark issue and the revisions to the Office of Congressional Ethics later this year. The ethics office was created in 2008 at the urging of Representative Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat who was then the House speaker. This was in response to criticism that the Select Committee on Ethics, comprising lawmakers from both parties, was ineffective, given a string of   corruption cases and other breakdowns such as a scandal involving teenage House pages. Lawmakers from both parties were against the office then, as well as now, and would much prefer to be judged by their peers  —   politicians currently serving in the House who might be more sympathetic  —   as opposed to a more discrete board and staff. But in moving ahead with the rules change on a strictly partisan basis, Republicans opened the door to Democrats berating them for the proposal, even though a significant number of Democrats are just as unhappy with the ethics office. It was similar to a move House Republicans made in 2005 when they used the   rules package to weaken the ethics committee itself after a series of rebukes against Tom DeLay, the majority leader. That decision sparked an outcry from Democrats and watchdog groups that helped Democrats regain the majority the next year with a message that Republicans were fostering a culture of corruption. “I think it is always better to do changes to the ethics process in a bipartisan manner,” said John Feehery, a former top Republican aide in the House. “It protects you from political attacks. ” The tussle over the ethics office is just one illustration of how Mr. Trump and his outsider ideas could clash with his own party in Congress. Mr. Trump has vowed to move forward with a proposal to impose term limits on Congress, and many in the party are not happy with that idea. Other sources of friction are bound to emerge, given his campaign message about shaking up Washington. “I just could not believe that the Congress does not understand that, if anything, we need to bring sunshine in,” Mr. Jones said. House Republicans may understand that idea a little bit better now.');

Others have been convicted of armed robbery, drug trafficking and criminal association with the mafia. The classrooms are frugally equipped, behind windows protected by vertical and horizontal bars, although one has brightly colored paintings covering the walls. But none of that deterred Marco Albanese, a police officer for 19 years and a trained sommelier for five, from teaching a class of rapt students the finer points of deconstructing the bouquet of a chardonnay or pouring a rare vintage. Mr. Albanese, 43, is an instructor in an innovative effort at Lecce Penitentiary to teach inmates to be sommeliers, or wine stewards. The courses are part of a program to teach prisoners new professional skills, as well as to help them develop a bond with the region, which is renowned for its negroamaro grapes. The program has been enthusiastically embraced by the prisoner students, who were tasting white wines on a recent afternoon. It has also been an eye opener for Mr. Albanese. “I could see their human aspect, once they were out of their context,” Mr. Albanese, who traded in his police uniform for the crisp blue jacket and tie of a sommelier for the class. “And I didn’t have to keep the same distance, now that I was their ‘professor. ’” He added, “They also deserve a second chance, and it’s important that they know that the institutions do believe that they can be educated to a different life. ” In eight lessons, the group of 30 men and women, who are instructed in separate classes, learn how to taste, choose and serve local wines. “We hope to teach them the social value of work and the preciousness of their own territory, so that they can later choose to work here, already having the right skill set,” said Rita Russo, the director of Lecce Penitentiary, which is the largest in the region of Apulia. Inmates can also study for their high school diplomas, cultivate tomatoes, take theater classes and learn to be painters or tailors. Class begins with a slide show on the history of wine, explaining how it was drunk by the ancient Greeks and introducing the students to the Roman ancestors of modern sommeliers in Italy. On a school table, covered with a khaki tablecloth, stood wine glasses, ready for use. Three bottles of chardonnay, a red primitivo and a negroamaro stood on a table nearby. Mr. Albanese then addressed the prisoners, who sat facing him on stools listing the temperatures at which different wines should be served and how to store them in cellars. For a finale, he offered a   tip. “Do remember, even if you had Trump over for dinner, the pope would still be served first. The clergy does come first, even before heads of state,” he said, to raucous laughter. The prisoners, whose identity is being protected by the prison, were not allowed to be interviewed or photographed for this article. Roberto Giannone, who works for the local sommelier association, then demonstrated how to open a bottle, neatly slicing off the capsule covering the bottleneck in three cuts, inserting the corkscrew and smoothly pulling out the cork. “Once the cork is out,” he said, “use a napkin to show it to your customers. It’s an easy way to be polite and avoid objections. ” Since the 1970s, the Italian penal system has focused on   for inmates. However, a lack of funds for rehabilitation, as well as chronic overcrowding, means that thousands of incarcerated men and women have little to do all day. That has sparked some innovative rehabilitation programs, including a restaurant inside a   prison near Milan in which the waiters and cooks are inmates. But the sommelier class at the Lecce prison is believed to be unique in Italy. “Of course, sommelier courses can’t be considered a treatment,” said Georgia Zara, the head of a program at the University of Turin that offers a master’s degree in criminological and forensic psychology. “But they do educate inmates and create social interaction, which is very important. ” The classes also offer a “bridge between the jail context and the world outside, so it’s a small investment to reduce the risk of recidivism,” Ms. Zara said. Gianvito Rizzo, 53, is the chief executive at the Feudi di Guagnano, a local vintner that provides wine, like negroamaro, for the classes. He is also the creator of the sommelier classes at the prison. Mr. Rizzo has proposed that inmates start working on his nearly 75 acres of vines in the coming year under certain circumstances, some inmates in Italy are allowed to work outside prisons. “I see wine in a democratic way,” Mr. Rizzo said as he walked through his vineyard recently. “The countryside is the opposite to a cell. You are free. You smell nature, and learn to care for it. I think it’d be good also for inmates to try it out. ” Mr. Rizzo said that when he had received a master’s degree from the Bocconi University business school in Milan three decades ago, he had been “fixated” on doing something for his native region of Salento, in Apulia, on the heel of the Italian boot. He settled on going into the wine business, which had been struggling to convert farmers who cultivated for personal or local use into becoming larger producers. He now produces 16 different wines from grapes grown in vineyards that he and two friends and business partners inherited from their fathers, added to those that other friends asked them to cultivate on their behalf. He calls this collaborative effort his “first social experiment. ” When Mr. Rizzo heard about the penitentiary’s activities for prisoners, he proposed the sommelier classes to Ms. Russo. While it is unclear if any of the students will ever become professional sommeliers, the exposure to the world of wine provided by the classes has been very welcome. “I don’t even drink, but I’ve learned to sip it, smell it and taste it,” said one inmate, who is serving a   sentence and who was granted an exception to speak anonymously. “You can think it’s a small thing, but it means the world to us. ”');

But are we poor?” It’s a casual line that sets up a joke. (Penelope reminds Alex that they have a TV, a refrigerator and a laptop. “Those are things poor people have!” he says.) But it’s based on an acknowledgment you don’t really hear in prime time anymore: that there is a class divide, nebulous but real, and that your family is closer to the bad side of it. The new “One Day at a Time,” arriving on Friday, is lively and full of voice, a rare reboot that’s better than the original. It’s a throwback in the best sense, to an era of mainstream, socially engaged   sitcoms. And just as the political debate has pitted diversity against class in a   contest, it’s a reminder that the two aren’t mutually exclusive. In the 1970s, TV was full of characters living paycheck to paycheck, whether cabbies (“Taxi”) waitresses (“Alice”) auto mechanics (“Chico and the Man”) or brewery workers (“Laverne and Shirley”). Mr. Lear, the sitcom maestro of the era, produced a suite of shows like this: “All in the Family,” “Good Times,” “Sanford and Son. ” Mr. Lear, an   populist liberal, made   TV about the little guy. In part, the programming reflected the economy of the time. The average American wage peaked in 1973, and the middle class was broader. But, as income inequality began to grow in the 1980s and ’90s, TV, like any neighborhood buffeted by market forces, got gentrified. Advertising rates became increasingly tied to audience demographics, which made poorer viewers less valuable. Basic cable fragmented the viewership  —   more shows, made for smaller niches  —   and premium networks like HBO focused on series about the kind of people who could afford to pay for networks like HBO. TV courted upscale audiences by showing them versions of themselves. Goodbye, Roseanne Conner hello, Carrie Bradshaw. With few exceptions (like ABC’s “The Middle”) sitcoms moved into offices, cafes and living rooms populated by comfortably   characters. (A recent “ ” slyly acknowledged this remove its affluent parents were mortified when their youngest son took an aptitude test that pegged him as a future “skilled laborer. ”) Work  —   nonprofessional,     work  —   became the stuff of   reality TV (“Deadliest Catch”). Just as actual labor became increasingly invisible to consumers, shunted off overseas or hidden through     people entered TV through the poor door, or not at all. With “One Day at a Time”  —   like “Fuller House” and “Gilmore Girls,” another product of Netflix’s drive to exhume our every nostalgic memory  —   peak TV is restoring something of what peak TV took away: the kind of family that buys discounted meat at the grocery store and whose old car stalls when you turn on the  . The original “One Day at a Time,” based on the   Whitney Blake’s experience as a divorced mother, was lighter and more disposable than “All in the Family. ” (I still have warm memories of Mackenzie Phillips and Valerie Bertinelli duetting on “Don’t Go Breaking My Heart,” but let’s not kid ourselves.) But it spoke to the times. Compared with Mr. Lear’s outspoken Maude, Ann Romano (Bonnie Franklin) expressed her feminism practically  —   bouncing from job to job, getting the rent paid and raising two independent girls. (This was in 1975, just five years after it was deemed too outrageous to have Mary Richards be divorced in “The Mary Tyler Moore Show. ”) The update, which Mr. Lear produces with Gloria Calderón Kellett and Mike Royce, moves the setting from Indianapolis to Echo Park, Los Angeles, and reimagines the family as  . (Mr. Lear’s   remake of his own work recalls how he adapted the British “Steptoe and Son” as “Sanford and Son,” with an   cast.) Gloria Estefan reprises the theme song, now syncopated. There’s a   third generation: a   Rita Moreno as Penelope’s   mother, Lydia. The    daughter, Elena (Isabella Gomez, a charmer) is a school debate champ who sees her coming quinceañera as a tool of the patriarchy. The omnipresent apartment super, Schneider (Todd Grinnell)  —   played in the original by Pat Harrington, with a mustache that defined ’70s    —   is now a stubbly   hipster whose dad owns the building. The most productive rethinking involves Penelope, a veteran of Afghanistan who works as a medical assistant. The war ended her marriage  —   she separated from her husband, also a soldier, who developed a drinking problem from stress  —   and left her with anxiety and a bum shoulder. The show understands, in a way comedies about more privileged families don’t have to, that circumstances shape choices and exact costs. Despite the   laughs, the series works best in   dramedy mode. The season has a serial arc, and Ms. Machado (previously of “Six Feet Under”) handles the emotional material with a light touch. One of the strongest episodes is built around a long, frustrating phone call with the Department of Veterans Affairs as Penelope tries to wrangle a chiropractor referral. The   humor is clunkier. Stephen Tobolowsky carries some familiar workplace subplots as Penelope’s   boss, and the show leans heavily on Ricky   jokes about Lydia’s accent. Still, if the comedy can be dated, the retro approach  —   multicamera, theatrical,    —   feels current, as the headlines recall the tumult of the ’70s and the   seems to be tweeting from Archie Bunker’s armchair. (One of the season’s themes, immigration, lands harder, if differently, from the way it might have before the election.) Of course, one sitcom can represent only so much. Scripted TV still neglects   rural America, though Netflix has lately stepped into that gap with “The Ranch. ” NBC’s affable workplace sitcom “Superstore” speaks to an economy that, campaign rhetoric aside, is more about service and retail jobs than about assembly lines. Maybe they’ll have company soon: ABC, for instance, is talking about making its programming more    after the election. If efforts like this manage to find us the next “Roseanne,” that’s all good. But the new “One Day at a Time,” which arrives while Hispanic TV families are still a rarity, also casually refutes the lazy postelection punditry that “ ” is a euphemism for “white,” that there is an   choice between the “identity politics” of representing the underrepresented and a   focus on people’s economic struggles. If TV can help divided Americans see one another better, it’s by telling more specific stories of every kind. It’s true that we don’t see enough   people on TV, or military veterans or Hispanic families. And guess what? Sometimes, this “One Day at a Time” reminds us, you find all those people under the same roof.');

I envision the audience to be that ocean of white folk I encounter who are deeply empathetic to the struggles of minorities  —   they are the ones who ask me, “What can I do, as a white person?” This is my attempt to address them in the most useful and, hopefully, edifying manner. What’s your strategy for getting through to the white people who may not be particularly sympathetic? What I’ve seen under the wonderful presidency of Barack Obama is the tendency to not tell white people the truth, for obvious reasons  —   they don’t vote for you. But I’m not a politician. I don’t have that power or influence, but what I do wield is a different kind of bully pulpit. We have to have enough belief in white people to tell them the truth. They are grown! There are a lot of areas within race relations that seem like less of a conversation and more of an attempt to prove to white people that these issues  —   police brutality, for instance  —   are a real and present danger. I open this book with horror stories about my engagement with the police. These are the stories that have shaped me, that join me to the mass of people who, regardless of our station in life, regardless of educational attainment and achievement, have felt this. The president of the United States has these stories, the former attorney general has these stories and a prominent black intellectual like me has these stories. The reality is that this is part and parcel of what it means to be black in America, and I wanted to spend time talking and thinking about it from a number of different perspectives to show white brothers and sisters that we aren’t making this up. This is not fabricated. I can’t help but think that if the same levels of police brutality were happening to white people, we would just disband the police. Police brutality would not be seen as the price of keeping our society safe. Recently, I was outside of Ben’s Chili Bowl in Washington at 3 a. m. and a young white kid is cursing the police, and I’m going, “Oh, my God, they’re going to shoot him. ” And then it occurred to me that they wouldn’t  —   he’s a white kid. And what did I hear the police say? “Now, son, you’re clearly inebriated. You need to go home and sleep this off. ” And I said to myself: “My God! This is what we want!” We can’t even afford a display of anger that many white people have. At the end of your sermon, you do a “benediction” section, in which you talk about making reparations on the local and individual level: donating to groups like the United Negro College Fund or a scholarship program, but also, to cite your example from the book, paying “the black person who cuts your grass double what you might ordinarily pay. ” That gave me pause! Good! I used to say in church, “If the sermon ain’t making you a little bit uncomfortable, it ain’t effective. ” Look, if it doesn’t cost you anything, you’re not really engaging in change you’re engaging in convenience.

Holson','2017-01-05',2017.0,1.0,NULL,'Condé Nast Publications might be sitting on a gold mine: its archive of some eight million photographs and illustrations from Vanity Fair, The New Yorker, Vogue, Architectural Digest and other magazines. Now, given the tenuous state of the media industry, the company has plans to exploit it. The archive is housed on the 15th floor of a building not far from Condé Nast’s headquarters at One World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan. Photographs and magazines, some going back more than 100 years, are stored in plastic slips and stacked in folders or tucked away in cabinets. Down the hall from the main room is a   locker, where original slides and transparencies are cataloged out of harm’s way. Here you will find the first cover of Vogue, from Dec. 17, 1892, a sketch of a debutante clad in a ball gown and floating on what appears to be a cloud pillow. And here is a photograph of Coco Chanel lounging on a sofa, taken by the Vogue photographer Horst P. Horst, who died in 1999. Binders stand on metal shelves, packed with transparencies from   runway shows in New York and Paris, a chronicle of shifting necklines, hems and bejeweled bodices. “This is the history of fashion,” said Ivan Shaw, 48, the former executive photo director of Vogue, who was named Condé Nast’s photography director for the archive in June. If all goes according to plan, much of this material will soon be the stuff of   prints,      coffee mugs, tote bags, pillows and such. Further, the company will invite the   known as influencers to explore the archive  —   videographers in tow  —   to discuss their favorite pieces and grab the interest of their   audiences. Mr. Shaw is part of a team charged with expanding sales of the archival goods. Since his appointment, as a major part of the initiative, he has been readying an online store, to be called Condé Nast Editions. Until recently, the archive team’s priority was preservation. But given the industrywide losses in print advertising, Condé Nast and other media companies are turning to new sources of revenue. “These images have unprecedented value,” said Cathy Hoffman Glosser, who was hired as the company’s senior vice president for licensing in 2015. “And we want these assets to become more accessible. ” Mr. Shaw calls the trove a time machine. “There is a story about every picture from an artist, what he or she has taken,” he said. He mentioned Edward Steichen, who worked for Vogue and Vanity Fair for 15 years beginning in the 1920s. “When I’m holding a photograph by Edward Steichen, for that moment, I am there. ” One of the photographers whose work has gained new attention since the opening of the archive is Horst, a favorite of Mr. Shaw’s, whose Vogue career flourished under the editor Diana Vreeland in the 1960s. In October, Condé Nast published a Horst volume, “Around That Time: Horst at Home in Vogue,” edited by Hamish Bowles. In addition to producing the book, Mr. Shaw curated exhibitions of Horst’s work at SOCO Gallery in Charlotte, N. C. and Venus Over Los Angeles in California. Others of note whose work sits in the archive and may soon be available to the wider world include Arthur Elgort, Robert Frank, George   Herbert Matter, Helmut Newton, Irving Penn, John Rawlings and Bert Stern, and the illustrators Miguel Covarrubias and Bob Staake. Condé Nast is not free to make commercial use of all its artists’ works, however Annie Leibovitz, who shoots for Vanity Fair and Vogue, owns the rights to her photographs. In a   of the archive’s appeal, Paddle8 recently offered three limited editions of The New Yorker’s May 2, 2016, “Purple Rain” cover illustration, a tribute to Prince by the artist Bob Staake, for $2, 700 apiece. (One has sold thus far.) Buyers with lighter wallets paid $95 for prints of the same cover at The New Yorker online store (189 were sold, Mr. Shaw said) or $325 for a signed,   version of the magazine cover (fans bought 121 of those). Mr. Shaw said he had two exhibitions and book projects in development on 1970s fashion photography, drawing on Vogue’s library, and a documentary in the works on Mr. Elgort, 76, the   Vogue photographer. Camilla Nickerson, a fashion editor at Vogue who worked with Mr. Shaw, said, “He has had to deal with a lot personalities and egos and he is good at being able to cope with their enormous needs. ” But Mr. Shaw seems most interested in the images themselves. While flipping through a 1957 copy of Architectural Digest, he lingered over a picture by Julius Shulman, whose photographs of Southern California architecture captured midcentury style. “You really feel like what the room would be like,” Mr. Shaw said, gazing at a Shulman photograph of a chic living room. “It’s not just a document. Look at the reproduction quality. I could look at these pictures all day long. ”');

Trump’s repeated questioning of Russia’s role. They suggested that the doubts Mr. Trump has expressed on Twitter about the agencies’ competence and impartiality were undermining their morale. “There’s a difference between skepticism and disparagement,” James R. Clapper Jr. the director of national intelligence, said at a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee on the Russian hacks. He added that “our assessment now is even more resolute” that the Russians carried out the attack on the election. The Senate hearing was the prelude to an extraordinary meeting scheduled for Friday, when Mr. Clapper and other intelligence chiefs will repeat for Mr. Trump the same detailed, highly classified briefing on the Russian attack that President Obama received on Thursday. In effect, they will be telling the   that the spy agencies believe he won with an assist from President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Then Mr. Trump will have to say whether he accepts the agencies’ basic findings on Russia’s role or holds to his previous contention that inept, politicized American spies have gotten the perpetrator of the hacking wrong. That would throw the intelligence agencies into a crisis of credibility and status with few, if any, precedents. In a pair of Twitter posts early Thursday, Mr. Trump appeared to back away from the scorn he had previously expressed for the intelligence agencies’ work, as well as from his embrace of Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, which released most of the hacked emails of Democratic officials. “The dishonest media likes saying that I am in agreement with Julian Assange  —   wrong,” he wrote. “I simply state what he states, it is for the people to make up their own minds as to the truth. The media lies to make it look like I am against ‘Intelligence’ when in fact I am a big fan!” But on Thursday night, the   returned to Twitter and appeared to underscore his doubts about the F. B. I. ’s investigation of the hacking. “The Democratic National Committee would not allow the FBI to study or see its computer info after it was supposedly hacked by Russia,” he wrote, a day after a report by BuzzFeed on the issue. “So how and why are they so sure about hacking if they never even requested an examination of the computer servers? What is going on?” Early next week, the public will get its fullest information to date on the evidence the agencies have to support their contention that Mr. Putin’s government used the hacked emails to hurt Hillary Clinton’s campaign and help Mr. Trump’s. Mr. Clapper said he would “push the envelope” to include as much detail as possible in the unclassified version of the intelligence agencies’ report on the Russian operation. The hacking, he added, was only one part of that operation, which also included the dissemination of “classical propaganda, disinformation, fake news. ” Mr. Clapper will step down as intelligence director later this month after a career in intelligence and military service that began when he enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1961. His replacement is expected to be Dan Coats, a retired senator from Indiana, a Trump transition official said Thursday. A   conservative who served on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr. Coats would oversee the nation’s 16 intelligence agencies in a job that was created after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to improve the sharing of information, but that is sometimes criticized as adding a layer of bureaucracy. The Coats news came on the same day that R. James Woolsey, a former C. I. A. director, stepped down as a senior adviser to Mr. Trump, citing his diminishing role in the transition. The Senate hearing on Thursday, devoted to foreign cyberthreats, was unusual as much for its context as its content  —   a public, bipartisan display of support for the intelligence community that seemed aimed, at times, at an audience of one. Though Mr. Clapper and most Republican senators were careful to avoid antagonizing the   directly, the hearing spoke to the rift Mr. Trump has threatened to create between the incoming administration and the intelligence officials assigned to inform it. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and chairman of the committee, said the purpose of the gathering was “not to question the outcome of the presidential election” but to move forward with a full understanding of what had happened. Repeatedly, though, Mr. McCain and his colleagues seemed to undercut Mr. Trump’s past messages of support for Russia, and for Mr. Assange of WikiLeaks. “Do you think there’s any credibility we should attach to this individual?” Mr. McCain asked. “Not in my view,” Mr. Clapper said. Another witness at the hearing, Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the head of the National Security Agency and United States Cyber Command, said he agreed. The intelligence director said he welcomed skeptical questioning from Mr. Trump, allowing that the intelligence community was “not perfect. ” “We are an organization of human beings, and we’re prone, sometimes, to make errors,” Mr. Clapper said. But he said the agencies had learned from their failures, notably their declaration that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Democrats on the committee repeatedly coaxed intelligence leaders to rebut Mr. Trump’s multiple assertions that a random individual hacker might have hacked Democratic targets. Senator Joe Donnelly, Democrat of Indiana, told Mr. Clapper that in the conflict between the intelligence agencies and Mr. Assange over Russian responsibility for the attack, “We’re on your side every time. ” He asked Mr. Clapper to convey his level of confidence in attributing the election attack to Russia, rather than “someone in his basement. ” “It’s, uh, very high,” the laconic intelligence director replied. At one point, Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, wondered aloud “who benefits from a   trashing the intelligence community. ” Ms. McCaskill said there would be “howls from the Republican side of the aisle” if a Democrat had spoken about intelligence officials as Mr. Trump had. Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia and Mrs. Clinton’s running mate, used the occasion for an aside about Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s choice for national security adviser, who has a history of sharing discredited news stories and conspiracy theories. Mr. Kaine said that he was unsure whether Mr. Flynn was acting out of “gullibility” or “malice,” but that it was a cause for “great concern” that Mr. Flynn shared stories that “most fourth graders would find incredible. ” No Republican lawmakers embraced Mr. Trump’s remarks casting doubt on the intelligence conclusions, though some were more conspicuous than others in their efforts to distance themselves. Perhaps the closest to a defense of Mr. Trump came from Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas. Denouncing “imprecise language” stating that Russia “hacked the election,” Mr. Cotton asked Mr. Clapper to confirm that the actual balloting was not affected. Mr. Cotton also suggested that the conventional wisdom that Mr. Putin favored Mr. Trump over Mrs. Clinton might be wrong. Mr. Trump promised a stronger military and more American oil and gas production  —   policies Mr. Cotton suggested would not be to Russia’s advantage. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, criticized the Obama administration for its response to the Russian attack. He said the White House had lobbed mere “pebbles” in retaliation for the interference. “When it comes to interfering with our election, we better be ready to throw rocks,” he said. Then Mr. Graham issued a warning for fellow Republicans who might be inclined to brush off any attack on an opposing party. “Could it be Republicans next election?” he asked. “It’s not like we’re so much better at cybersecurity than Democrats. ”');

Shear','2017-01-06',2017.0,1.0,NULL,'WASHINGTON  —     Donald J. Trump is expected to choose as director of national intelligence   Senator Dan Coats, a former ambassador to Germany, secret foodie and lover of all things Indiana who also served as a member of his chamber’s Intelligence Committee. Known for a   style, Mr. Coats was popular among his colleagues. “I always thought he should wear a red cardigan,” said Senator Cory Gardner, Republican of Colorado. “He was the closest thing to Mister Rogers we could come up with. ” While fiscally conservative, Mr. Coats, an Indiana Republican who completed his second Senate stint this month, often found common cause with Democrats, who described him as thoughtful on intelligence and national security issues, with a sharp intellect and disarming humor. “I have always been impressed with his demeanor,” said Senator Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with the Democrats, and who served on the Intelligence Committee with Mr. Coats and traveled with him in Eastern Europe. “He’s not a fierce partisan and knows the intelligence community. He’s very amiable and easy to work with. ” The position of America’s top intelligence official was created by Congress in 2004, as a response to criticism that the nation’s spy agencies had failed to detect and prevent the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. Since then, the director has been charged with coordinating the   and analysis of the country’s 16 civilian and military spy agencies, helping to prevent a terrorist attack and serving as a central liaison to presidents and their White House staff. But bureaucratic turf wars have dogged the office of the director of national intelligence since its creation. Officials who run the C. I. A. and the Defense Intelligence Agency, among others, have sought to maintain control over parts of the spying apparatus, and to exert influence with presidents and members of Congress. In 2009, for example, Leon E. Panetta, President Obama’s incoming C. I. A. director, clashed with Dennis C. Blair, the director of national intelligence at the time, after Mr. Blair sought to select the top American spies for overseas postings. Mr. Panetta sent a dispatch to the agency’s employees telling them to ignore Mr. Blair’s message  —   an assertion that the C. I. A. was in charge. The rivalries have weakened the national intelligence office and led some critics in the government to question its effectiveness. The year that Mr. Obama took office, an internal report criticized the office of national intelligence for adding to  —   not removing  —   bureaucratic bloat and doing little to end the tensions among the various spy agencies. In 2010, James R. Clapper Jr. the current director of national intelligence, insisted during his Senate confirmation hearings that he would not be a “hood ornament,” saying that despite the inherent limitations on his job, he would try to bring an end to turf battles among the nation’s spy agencies. Six years later, the job appears to have limited appeal to some intelligence professionals, several of whom were not eager to serve in the position for fear that they would not be empowered. Mr. Coats had been an early and strong contender for secretary of defense in the first term of President George W. Bush, until Mr. Bush’s vice president, Dick Cheney, successfully pressed for Donald H. Rumsfeld. Mr. Coats, 73, graduated from Wheaton College in Illinois, and served in the Army before studying at the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law. He began a career in life insurance in Fort Wayne, Ind. before joining the office of   Dan Quayle as a district representative. Mr. Coats owed much of his political career to his ties to Mr. Quayle, the former vice president. Mr. Coats won Mr. Quayle’s House seat in 1980, the year the latter was elected to the Senate. After Mr. Quayle was elected vice president in 1988, Mr. Coats was appointed to fill his seat he served on the Senate Armed Services and Intelligence Committees. In 1998, Mr. Coats decided to not seek   largely because the Democratic challenger, Evan Bayh, was considered unbeatable. In 2001, Mr. Coats was named ambassador to Germany, arriving only three days before the Sept. 11 attacks. “Ambassador Coats found himself thrown into a role he couldn’t have foreseen a day earlier, a role in which he would excel but one that would forever change him,” Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said on the Senate floor last year in remarks praising Mr. Coats. “Those who know Dan Coats say that day in September affected him profoundly,” he said. “He may not have known it then, but he would feel the tug of that responsibility many years later, and answer the call. ” After a brief foray into lobbying, Mr. Coats returned to the Senate in January 2011, serving again on the Intelligence Committee. Mr. Coats was also one of only a few Republican senators who supported compelling Congress to officially authorize the use of military force abroad. “You’re asking our sons and daughters to take up our cause,” he said, “and every person who is here has to decide with their own conscience if that’s something we’re going to do. ” Mr. Coats enjoys visiting restaurants both in Indianapolis and in small hamlets that serve    food, and featured several interesting restaurants and food purveyors when it was his turn to host lunch for his Republican colleagues.');

Williams, Ph.D.','2017-01-13',2017.0,1.0,NULL,'The Vatican has invited the most notorious population alarmist in recent history to speak at an upcoming   conference titled ‘Biological Extinction. ”[The conference, sponsored jointly by the Pontifical Academy of Science and the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, will address issues of biodiversity, “great extinctions” of history, population and demographics.  Dr. Paul R. Ehrlich —  who has defended mass sterilization,   abortion and infanticide —  will speak on “Causes and Pathways of Biodiversity Losses: Consumption Preferences, Population Numbers, Technology, Ecosystem Productivity. ” To allow women to have as many children as they want, Ehrlich has said, is like letting people “throw as much of their garbage into their neighbor’s backyard as they want. ” Ehrlich became famous through the publication of his 1968 doomsday bestseller, The Population Bomb, which generated mass hysteria over the future of the world and the earth’s ability to sustain human life. In the book, Ehrlich launched a series of frightening predictions that turned out to be spectacularly wrong, creating the myth of unsustainable population growth. He prophesied that hundreds of millions would starve to death in the 1970s (and that 65 million of them would be Americans) that   India was doomed, and that odds were fair that “England will not exist in the year 2000. ” Ehrlich concluded that “sometime in the next 15 years, the end will come,” meaning “an utter breakdown of the capacity of the planet to support humanity. ” Mankind stood on the brink of Armageddon, the book proposed, because there was no way to feed the exponentially increasing world population. The opening line set the tone for the whole work: “The battle to feed all of humanity is over. ” Despite Ehrlich’s utter failure to predict humanity’s ability to feed itself, his theories will be dusted off and   in the Vatican in late February. In its brochure for the upcoming workshop, the Vatican asserts in Ehrlichian doomspeak that “Earth cannot sustain” our desire for “enhanced consumption. ” Humanity is presently using about 156 percent of “the Earth’s sustainable capacity” every year, the text contends, and it is therefore essential to address “the question whether the Earth system is able to support the demands that humanity has been making on it” and “how global inequality and poverty relate to that. ” The conference will also feature a speaker from an environmental advocacy group called the Global Footprint Network (GFN) which each year calculates the day when the year’s available resources supposedly run out and mankind begins overconsuming nature. “We use more ecological resources and services than nature can regenerate through overfishing, overharvesting forests and emitting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than forests can sequester,” the group exclaims on its website. “On August 8, 2016, we will have used as much from nature as our planet can renew in the whole year,” GFN announced last summer. In their brochure, the Pontifical Academies make the counterintuitive claim that biodiversity means “everything” for the human race, but then proceed to acknowledge that only 103 species of plants out of an estimated 425, 000 species produce about 90 percent of our food worldwide. Moreover, just three kinds of grain, maize, rice, and wheat, produce about 60 percent of the total, the text notes. Since none of these species are under any danger of extinction, one wonders how biodiversity can mean “everything” for humanity. Just why the Vatican would wish to showcase the purveyor of debunked, apocalyptic theories is anybody’s guess, but it certainly cannot bode well for the relationship between faith and science.

[The budget, promoted by House Speaker Paul Ryan, will allow Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly to expand the number of foreign workers who come to the U. S. for   jobs by at least 20, 000.  The   visa brings foreign nationals to the U. S. for   nonagricultural jobs. The visa impacts   and poor Americans most, as jobs in the hotel industry, theme parks, retail, and restaurants can insource jobs to foreign workers under the program.   visa workers filled more than half a million jobs in the U. S. in the past five years. The North America’s Building Trades Unions (NABTU) is denouncing the plan, saying it will further undercut   American workers and the security of their jobs. “This maneuver runs directly counter to President’s Trump’s recent executive actions to ‘buy American and hire American,’ and which were specifically crafted to instruct the Departments of Labor, Justice, Homeland Security, and State to take prompt action to crack down on fraud and abuse in our immigration system in order to protect workers in the United States and their economic conditions,” NABTU officials said in a statement. “The   visa was conceived as a   guest worker program that is meant to be used by employers to fill seasonal and temporary jobs, but which has now been all too often used by unscrupulous employers in the construction industry as a means to exploit guest workers and drive down community wage and benefit standards,” the organization continued. “The many horrific abuses within the   program have long been documented, and NABTU has repeatedly sought reforms to address the shortcomings in the law that have enabled these abuses to continue unabated. ” NABTU argues that the language in the omnibus spending bill, passed by the House, does not “address” or “reform” the problems within the   visa system, saying “it doubles down on bad policy which will have the effect of further jeopardizing the jobs, wages and benefits of American construction workers, while ensuring that guest workers remain vulnerable to abuse. ” The   expansion slipped into the spending bill came as a treat to the big business and open borders lobbies, who through the   Workforce Coalition organization, successfully lobbied Congress to expand the number of   foreign workers who can enter the U. S. every year, as Breitbart Texas reported. Breitbart Texas reported how American wages are struggled to increase in professions covered by the   visa. For instance, for landscaping and   jobs given to   foreign workers, wages decreased by 3. 4 percent between 2004 and 2014. For jobs in the amusement and recreation industry, which also employs a multitude of   foreign workers, wages between 2004 and 2014 fell by 1. 3 percent. Overall, in the top 15 industries that employ   foreign workers, wages increased in the last decade by 1. 8 percent. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart Texas.

[The Post tried a   hit on White House strategist (and former Breitbart News executive) Steve Bannon, describing a hostile meeting between him and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly that didn’t actually happen.   As the Washington Post’s editors eventually admitted, reporter Josh Rogin went with the same sort of anonymous sourcing that has produced so many Fake News debacles since the election, without contacting the White House to verify the account.  According to the original story, Secretary Kelly wanted to “issue a waiver for lawful permanent residents, a. k. a.   holders, from the seven   countries whose citizens had been banned from entering the United States,” but Bannon “wanted to stop Kelly in his tracks and told him not to issue the order. ” A battle royale supposedly ensued: The disagreement between Bannon and Kelly pitted a political operator against a military disciplinarian. Two administration officials gave the following account of their exchange: Respectfully but firmly, the retired general told Bannon that despite his high position in the White House and close relationship with President Trump, the former Breitbart chief was not in Kelly’s chain of command. If the president wanted Kelly to back off from issuing the waiver, Kelly would have to hear it from the president directly, he told Bannon. It was only a matter of hours before an editorial correction was appended to that paragraph, and acknowledged at the top of the article: White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Kelly and Bannon spoke on Jan. 27 and 29, but denied they had a confrontation over the green card waiver. In an email sent late Saturday, Bannon also denied a confrontation with Kelly and said he had not told him to withhold the waiver. Spicer didn’t merely deny the confrontation he told the Huffington Post it was a “patently false,   story,” and said the Washington Post’s failure to seek White House comment before publishing the article was “unbelievably unprofessional. ” “Prior to publication of this column, The Post sought comment from the Department of Homeland Security but not from the White House. We should have done both. The article has been updated,” editor Fred Hiatt conceded, in a notice that now appears at the top of the piece. “I think we got things wrong in this column. That’s why we published an editor’s note and a correction. I regret getting things wrong. We try really hard not to, but we do make mistakes. And when we make mistakes, we try to correct them and be transparent to the readers what we got wrong,” Hiatt told the Huffington Post. On February 7th, Mediaite quoted Secretary Kelly dismissing the Washington Post piece as a “fantasy story,” and throwing in some harsh words for reporter Josh Rogin. “Every paragraph, every sentence, every word, every space, every comma, every period is wrong. It was a fantasy story,” Kelly told Rep. Kathleen Rice ( ) when she asked if he was worried about pressure from White House political operatives. “This reporter, whoever he is, got it so wrong that’s assuming he’s not making it up,” Kelly added. The Secretary of Homeland Security proceeded to emphasize that “I work for one man. His name is Donald Trump. He has told me one thing: Secure the border. ” The Washington Post article was a lengthy discourse on debates that really are occurring within the Trump administration, over a policy that has generated much debate among the public. It would have worked just fine without the disputed anecdote, but then it would have lacked the “White House political operators bullying Cabinet officials” angle.  (Especially this particular White House political operative, Bannon, having assumed totemic stature among adversarial media, and adversarial media having returned from an   hiatus on the morning of November 9th, 2016.) The Post’s failure to consult the people actually involved in the alleged showdown between Bannon and Kelly is cast in an especially poor light by the speed of the administration’s response to their post. How can reporters and editors justify not even trying to solicit a comment from the White House on an explosive story from anonymous sources? Contrary to Hiatt’s statement to the Huffington Post, his team didn’t “try really hard” not to get this one wrong. Also, as the Huffington Post observed, that little story about the row between Bannon and Kelly zoomed around cyberspace many times before the corrections were made. In the Internet era, it’s more critical than ever to get the story right the first time. Fake News gets thousands of Retweets, while the corrections get hundreds at best.  Isn’t that precisely the point mainstream media apologists made, when they launched their crusade against Fake News from alternative outlets? Didn’t they boast of their superior reporting and editorial standards as vital tools for successfully pursuing the truth in a time of   disinformation? Perhaps the road to recovery could begin with more healthy skepticism toward stories pushed by anonymous sources who might be nursing grudges against the new administration.');

A tall, handsome, charismatic Maryland officer known for his sizable ego, Steward fought fearlessly in battle for a cause he ardently believed in  —   the United States. [In late August of 1776, the British Army landed more than twenty thousand troops on Long Island, where they planned to annihilate the Patriot forces. British General William Howe ordered a third of his Redcoats and Hessians to attack Washington’s troops head on, while the remainder circled around behind to trap the Americans.  The battle evolved exactly according to Howe’s plan, and within hours, he had trapped Washington and his men on the Heights of Gowanus in Brooklyn. The end seemed near for the young American army. To give hundreds of men in Washington’s army time to escape, the Marylanders mounted a series of suicidal bayonet charges against an old stone house occupied by British General Lord Cornwallis and his Redcoats. Flanked by thousands of British and Hessian troops, a few hundred men fought desperately and somehow bought enough time for the bulk of Washington’s men to withdraw. Washington, watching the action unfold through his spyglass, cried out “Good God! What brave fellows I must this day lose!” Many of the Marylanders involved in the charge sacrificed their lives. Most lie in a mass grave somewhere near the epic stand in Brooklyn. The exact whereabouts of the mass grave remains one of the greatest unsolved mysteries of the Revolution. But a handful of Marylanders survived. To stay alive, they would have to swim eighty yards across Gowanus Creek while under a hail of fire. Witnessing his brothers in danger, Lt. Steward jumped into action. He provided covering fire as the Marylanders swam for their lives. His valiant actions saved many of his Maryland brothers, who would eventually form the core of the regiment that Washington would call upon time and again in the inflection points of some of the greatest battles of the American Revolution. The story of Steward and the other Marylanders is captured in the   book Washington’s Immortals, recently released in paperback. This unique book is the first Band of Brothers treatment of the American Revolution, detailing the most important elements of nearly every significant battle of The War of Independence. Steward’s next bold stand arose at the Battle of Staten Island in August 1777, when the Americans mounted a raid against a British outpost. At first, the Patriots caught the British by surprise and quickly captured dozens of prisoners and large quantities of supplies. But the Redcoats regrouped and drove the Continental troops back to their boats. Steward led a desperate rear guard, holding off hundreds of British troops long enough for most of the raiding party to escape. When all the boats retreated from the island, the enemy surrounded Steward, forcing him to surrender. They placed him on one of the prison ships docked in New York Harbor. Often called “hell ships,” these vessels served as floating concentration camps where prisoners (as many as 15, 000 Americans) slowly starved or perished from disease in the cramped,   quarters. However, knowing he would “only live once,” the indomitable Steward miraculously escaped via a rowboat he purloined and rejoined Washington’s Army. By July 1779, the War of Independence had tediously dragged on for more than three years, and the Americans had survived a brutal winter at Valley Forge. After vigilantly gathering actionable intelligence on the British outpost at Stony Point, Washington ordered a raid to assault the fort and remove the threat the British fortification posed to American defenses in the Hudson Valley. Rather than deploy his entire army, which could have played into a British counterattack, Washington unleashed more than 1, 000 men from his light infantry, a corps “composed of the best, most hardy and active marksmen. ” The volunteer force, unencumbered by baggage and heavy artillery, earned renown for their daring, alertness, and efficiency. Jack Steward commanded a unit within the light infantry. Steward, now a major, first rode out with the commander of the raid Brigadier General “Mad Anthony” Wayne to spy out the lay of the land and take a closer look at the Stony Point’s defenses. Wayne realized that to have any chance of success he would need a “forlorn hope,” in today’s parlance, a suicide squad. Their mission was to cut through the thick abatis while under fire from the heavily defended fort. The sharpened logs  —   the eighteenth century equivalent of barbed wire  —   and multiple cannon made the fort nearly impregnable. Steward volunteered to lead the forlorn hope and the advance guard, the first to pierce the Point’s defenses. He encouraged men to join him, saying, “I want no men but the best, those that are willing to face death for their country. ” Steward’s advance guard consisted entirely of volunteers, “desperadoes led by officers of distinguished merit. ” The most fervent Patriots volunteered to be part of the forlorn hope, which they considered an immensely honorable post. Steward garnered so many volunteers that the men had to draw lots to determine who would join. Under the cover of darkness, Steward and his forlorn hope stealthily approached the fort. To preserve the element of surprise, General “Mad Anthony” Wayne ordered, “Should there be any soldier so lost to every feeling of honor, as to attempt to retreat one single foot or skulk in the face of danger, the officer next to him is immediately to put him to death. ” The same fate would befall any man who spoke or discharged his musket. The officers carried spontoons  —   long, menacing,   iron pikes on the end of wooden poles  —   which would be used without hesitation to fulfill General Wayne’s order should the need arise (Wayne didn’t provision “safe spaces” for the light infantry). And the need did arise  —   at least one man who attempted to flee was run through by an American officer. Once on the abatis, Steward’s men began hacking away. Within seconds, a British sentry sounded the alarm, and drummers beat the call to arms. As the axes cut a small opening in the British defenses, musket balls and grape shot from cannon tore into Steward’s men. However, the forlorn hope persisted, eventually cutting a hole wide enough for the rest of the American light infantry to infiltrate. But the forlorn hope was not finished. Steward’s men had to penetrate the second abatis, with the British now fully alert and firing their cannons and muskets. Men fell, cut down by the deadly fire, but the axes finally succeeded in breaching the defenses. Steward and his advance guard poured through the opening, leading the assault on the fort. The Americans won the day, achieving a crucial victory that boosted morale among the Patriots. General Wayne reported the victory to Washington, noting, “Our officers and men behaved like men who are determined to be free. ” For his daring actions at Stony Point, Jack Steward received a Congressional Silver Medal, a precursor to the Medal of Honor  —   one of only about a dozen medals awarded during the Revolution. Steward, promoted to colonel, would go on to fight in many more critical battles of the Revolution in the South.   for his day, he petitioned to lead a regiment of African Americans, but the idea never got off the ground. The Man of Forlorn Hope survived countless battles and witnessed the Yorktown surrender of Cornwallis  —   the very general that killed so many of his Maryland brothers at the stone house in Brooklyn. The war nearly over, Steward was riding on the outskirts of Charleston, to George Washington’s nephew, William Washington’s wedding party when his horse fell. “And the Colonel pitching on his head in a ditch, dislocated his neck. He lived till Sunday morning about seven o’clock and then died. ” Maryland’s indestructible man, who had survived the Battle of Brooklyn, escaped a prison ship, led the forlorn hope at Stony Point, and fought in many battles in South, including Yorktown, died 234 years ago this week. The officers of the Maryland Line, Steward’s friends, gathered to mourn. The next day, they interred Steward with every military honor. “This gentlemen, whose untimely death is much to be lamented, had served with great reputation during the war, and was much beloved by the army. ” He only lived once, but made the most of that life, dedicating it to the cause of American freedom.

And in Part Two we saw how the Deep State, one of the many weapons in the globalist arsenal, is now targeting  Trump and his agenda for America.  Here in Part Three, we will focus on how one   Trump opponent is seeking to pick off a key member of the new presidential staff.  1. Fake News: “Bannon vs. Trump” Attacks on Stephen K. Bannon, the former executive chairman of Breitbart, slated to become the top strategist in the Trump White House, are nothing new.  Just since the election, Mother Jones magazine has called him “worse . . . than a racist,” Joy Behar labeled him “a fascist,” and former Vermont governor Howard Dean insisted, against all evidence, that he is “a Nazi. ”  You get the idea.   Okay, these   assaults haven’t gotten very far they were tried, too, during the 2016 campaign, and Bannon’s standing within Trump world has never wavered.  And yet, of course, the assaults keep coming.  And so to help keep track of them all, perhaps we should assign them into categories.  For example, in an earlier article, not part of this series, Virgil cited the ways in which “argument from authority” —  argumentum ad verecundiam —  can be used and, more often these days, misused.    So now we can add a second, slyer, category of media falsehood.  We can call this one the “assertion of a false conflict,” declaratio contra falsum.  This one is a version of the familiar attempt to stir the pot, whipping up hard feelings between people: Hey, did you hear what he said about you?  And here’s Brooks’ description of the gist of Bannon’s speech:  Humane capitalism has been replaced by the savage capitalism that brought us the financial crisis.  National democracy has been replaced by a   network of global elites.  Traditional virtue has been replaced by abortion and gay marriage.  Sovereign   are being replaced by hapless multilateral organizations like the E. U.  Decadent and enervated, the West lies vulnerable in the face of a confident and convicted Islamofascism, which is the cosmic threat of our time. So that’s how Brooks characterizes Bannon’s beliefs.  And Brooks is just warming up.  He then goes on to compare Trump to Vladimir Putin, and Bannon to a conservative Russian political figure in Putin’s orbit, Alexander Dugin.   Yet after making these dark comparisons, Brooks offers his readers a ray of light: The dark   he predicts, will fail.  Why? Because, Brooks chortles, Trump is such a lazy, egocentric, lightweight that he will lose interest in these Bannonite topics and so will drift over to the side of the globalists.   A question leaps immediately to mind: Did Brooks get some scoop as to Trump’s thinking?  Some revelatory interview? The answer, Brooks indicates, is “no. ”  It’s just his hunch:  I’m personally betting the foreign policy apparatus, including the secretaries of state and defense, will grind down the populists around Trump. David Brooks has enjoyed a good career in the MSM.  Born in 1961, he’s nominally a conservative, having worked variously at National Review, The Wall Street Journal, The Weekly Standard, and, since 2003, as a opinion columnist for The New York Times. And along the way, he has expressed some interesting ideas for example, in 2006, he opined that Sens. John McCain and Joe Lieberman should form their own third party, based mostly on their shared neoconservatism and globalism.  Needless to say, nothing ever came of Brooks’ suggestion.   Over his career, Brook has been notable for three things: first, a book published in 2000 that celebrated the   luxe lifestyle second, a fervent advocacy of the 2003 Iraq War and third, his journalstic love affair with Barack Obama. In other words, he’s the perfect sort of housebroken “conservative” for Washington, DC, just the sort of fellow who gets that   gig on the PBS NewsHour.  Okay, so let’s consider Brooks’ track record on Donald Trump.  We can sum it up with two points: First, he hates Trump and second, he is not a good forecaster. In March of last year, the headline of his column was “No, Not Trump, Not Ever. ”  In that piece he harumphed, “Donald Trump is epically unprepared to be president. He has no realistic policies, no advisers, no capacity to learn. ”  Then Brooks really got going: Trump is perhaps the most dishonest person to run for high office in our lifetimes.  All politicians stretch the truth, but Trump has a steady obliviousness to accuracy. And since Trump was so terrible in Brooks’ mind, it was hard for him to imagine that anyone else could like him.  Thus in June 2016, he predicted that in the November election to come, Hillary Clinton would beat Trump.  As he put it, “People will be sick of Donald Trump, and they will go for her. ”  To cap it off, in a column published on November 4, four days before the 2016 general election, Brooks doubled down on his endorsement of Clinton, describing her as “the bigger change agent. ”  Then he went on to describe Trump as “solipsistic, impatient, combative, unsubtle and ignorant,” all the while insisting that Clinton was “better suited to getting things done. ”  Amusingly, among the things Clinton would get done, Brooks told his readers, was developing a plan to “secure the border. ”  Perfectly expressing the Times’ view of the world, Brooks added, “Any sensible person can distinguish between an effective operating officer [Clinton] and a whirling disaster who is only about himself [Trump]. ” Okay, so Brooks, along with 99. 9 percent of the rest of the Times, liked Clinton and didn’t like Trump.  We get that.  Yet further details of that column are revealing —  revealing, that is, about Brooks.  Here’s how the piece starts: A few weeks ago I met a guy in Idaho who was absolutely certain that Donald Trump would win this election.  He was wearing tattered, soiled overalls, missing a bunch of teeth and was unnaturally skinny.  He was probably about 50, but his haggard face looked 70.  He was getting by aimlessly as a handyman. We might linger over some of those snobby word choices: “tattered, soiled overalls . . . missing a bunch of teeth. ” Virgil might pause to ask: Since the 1972 movie Deliverance, has has there ever been a more profoundly perfect stereotype of how a posh Easterner looks down his nose at the rubes in the rest of the country?   In the piece, Brooks, himself blissfully confident that Hillary was going to prevail, then goes on recount how he tried patiently to explain to the man that he was wrong in his thinking.  And yet, Brooks writes with a sigh, “It was like telling him a sea gull could play billiards. ”  One might think that the actual election results, four days later, would have humbled Brooks a bit, but they haven’t —  not at all.   Since the election, he’s been as strongly   as ever.  And, amazingly, he’s still in the game of making predictions for Times readers, “The guy will probably resign or be impeached within a year. ” As for Steve Bannon, he has views that can only be described as Trumpian, and he has held them for a long time.  So of course the globalists hate him, too. Since Bannon only rarely gives interviews, some might be curious to know more about his thinking —  that is, looking beyond the nasty canards hurled at him by the likes of Mother Jones, Behar, and Dean. In fact, Bannon has been articulating his vision for a long time since 2004, he has produced no fewer than 16 documentaries.   Yet a more direct and personal window into Bannon’s thinking can be found in his 2014 speech to the Vatican that’s the one that Brooks ripped in his January 10 column.  So, without Brooks’ “help,” let’s take a closer look: Bannon begins by saying that he believes, strongly, that there’s “a crisis” in our time —  that is, “a crisis of our faith, a crisis of the West, a crisis of capitalism. ”  And so he begins with the spiritual question yes, many today are well off, but the question they should be asking themselves is deeper than money:  What is the purpose of whatever I’m doing with this wealth? What is the purpose of what I’m doing with the ability that God has given us, that divine providence has given us to actually be a creator of jobs and a creator of wealth? He continues in this vein: It really behooves all of us to really take a hard look and make sure that we are reinvesting that back into positive things. Yes, we should invest in positive things, things of faith and belief, which money can’t buy.  Thus the “crisis of faith. ”  So now we come to Bannon’s “crisis of the West. ”  Here, we need only look to Angela Merkel’s Germany it’s the richest country in Europe, and yet it is now in deadly danger of demographic dissolution —  and threatens to take the whole continent down with it.  Indeed, Bannon’s words from 2014, before Merkel foolishly chose to open her borders while subsidizing permanent dependence, now look prescient.  He warned then that the threat from jihadi Islam is “going to come to Europe . . . it’s going to come to the United Kingdom. ”  Moreover, in his talk he took note of a tweet that very day from ISIS, promising to turn the United States into a “river of blood. ” Yes, a crisis of the West, indeed.  Hawkins summarized Bannon’s Vatican speech, in which Bannon argued that in recent decades, capitalism seems to have come mostly in two forms, both at least somewhat pernicious: First, there’s the   “crony capitalism” that we saw in the scandalous 2008 bailouts and second, there’s the “Ayn Rand influenced . . . libertarian capitalism, which he sees as commoditizing people into mere producers and products. ”  This latter kind, Hawkins continued, weakens “our collective moral strength. ”   The answer, Hawkins concluded, is “enlightened capitalism” —  that is, the capitalism in which capitalists think about the fate of their country, not just their bank account.  As Hawkins put it: It was this enlightened capitalism that gave the   —  through wide asset ownership —    strong middle class and an aspirant and affluent working class which provided the moral and economic foundations for the West to defeat Nazism in 1945 and support Ronald Reagan in   to and defeating the Soviet Union during the Cold War.  And now this has been corrupted and in turn weakened the West itself and Bannon believes the West now faces losing everything it has gained across more than 2000 years. [emphasis added] Hawkins ended his essay with these hopeful words: With Bannon, Trump and “Trumpism” the US and the West has an opportunity for economic, moral and political renewal —  a new enlightenment.  Okay, so Hawkins ably describes the problem, and outlines the ultimate desired outcome.   And yet we might ask: How, exactly, does America get there?  How do we get from the crisis of 2017 to a better place —  as soon as possible?  For the answer, we might return to Bannon’s 2014 talk, in which he called for aggressively building “a   populist movement,” the heart of which should be: . . . the middle class, the working men and women in the world who are just tired of being dictated to by what we call the party of Davos. Interestingly, that seems to have happened in the last three years!  We can also pause to note that “Davos,” of course, is shorthand for the World Economic Forum, a conclave of billionaire globalists and their courtiers, meeting every year in Davos, Switzerland.  And so Bannon’s reference to “the party of Davos” speaks to the reality that global high finance seems to have conquered most of the politics, and most of the parties, of most of the world —  and as a result, the America middle class, now sinking in the globalist broth, has been made worse off.  It might be worth noting that the next Davos meeting is just a few days away, on January 17 to 20.  And since this is the first session since the November election, there’s going to be some   —  and a lot more attempted  .   And yet Davos Men, and Davos Women will not be giving up so easily.   For instance, one of the scheduled “chats” at Davos will be between Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook and Meg Whitman of HP together they will offer their   audience their   thoughts on shaping “a positive narrative for the global community. ”  That is, a “global community” that’s safely profitable for Facebook and HP, wherever in the world they might choose to operate.  Will these efforts at spinning globalism succeed?  Will the globalists be permitted to keep inflating their financial bubbles —  and keep getting bailed out when they pop?  The Davosians surely hope so, but it’s possible, after Trump (and before Trump, Brexit) that the jig is up.  But wait!  There’s still hope for the globalists.  The new American president might not think much of Davos, but the president of the People’s Republic of China, Xi Jinping, thinks differently. Indeed, he is scheduled to speak at Davos in a few days it will the   appearance by a Chinese head of state.    We can assume, of course, that Xi, picking up the torch from, say, Barack Obama, will offer a   defense of globalism after all, globalism has been very, very good for his country.   4. Trump’s Moment, In the meantime, the eyes of the world are on the    45th president.  As noted in Part One, Trump’s energetic economic activism is already making itself felt: And the good news has continues to pour forth: Just on January 12, Amazon announced that it would commit to creating 100, 000 new jobs in the US.  Moreover, on January 13, Lockheed, which had earlier been chastised by Trump for   announced that it would pledge not only lower costs for its   fighter, but also an additional 1800 jobs in Texas.   As Virgil also noted earlier, it’s astonishing that past presidents didn’t engage in this sort of       economic patriotism perhaps they didn’t know how, or perhaps they didn’t care.   In any case, Trump does know how, and he does care.  And the American people are noticing.  According to a January 10 Quinnipiac Poll, 47 percent of Americans believe that Trump’s economic policies will help the economy, while only 31 percent say they will hurt.  In other words, Trump has already built for himself a   advantage on that question.  And his presidency has not yet even begun.  To be sure, in the next few years, Trump, and his team, will be tested again and again.  And while it’s impossible to predict the future, it would be foolish to bet against them.');
INSERT INTO mytable(id,title,publication,author,date,year,month,url,content) VALUES (50436,'Alcohol abuse linked to higher heart risks, study says','CNN',NULL,'2017-01-02',2017.0,1.0,NULL,'(CNN) An estimated 10 million to 15 million Americans abuse alcohol, meaning excessive drinking negatively affects their lives. Now, research suggests a link between too much drinking and heart problems, the No. 1 cause of death worldwide.  Abusing alcohol increases the likelihood of suffering atrial fibrillation, heart attack or congestive heart failure, according to a study published Monday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. ”One of the most surprising findings. .. is that people who abused alcohol are at increased risk for heart attack or myocardial infarction,” said Dr. Gregory M. Marcus, director of clinical research in the Division of Cardiology at the University of California, San Francisco and senior author of the study. Past data suggests that moderate drinking may be protective, he said, helping ward off this disease. Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, director of women’s heart health at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, believes that both scientists and the media have been highlighting the good components of alcohol, such as resveratrol in wine, and ”been really pushing that a glass of wine is good for our health.” But the bottom line of this new study is clear, she said. ”When we look at alcohol, we have almost glamorized it as being this substance that can help us live a really   life,” said Steinbaum, who was not involved in the research. ”I think, ultimately, drinking in excess leads to heart conditions, and we should really understand the potential toxicity of alcohol and not glamorize it as something we should include as part of our lives    certainly not in excess.” Millions of patient records, The National Institutes of Health frequently highlight the ways in which too much drinking can lead to accidents, cirrhosis and some cancers. Yet cardiovascular studies have suggested that moderate consumption of alcohol is good for our heart health.  The authors of the new study cite a 2007 study published in the journal Circulation. Not only did moderate drinking lead to no negative effects, the study authors concluded that ”moderate drinking may lower the risk of heart failure.”  Since many of us believe that ”more of a good thing is always better,” Marcus and his colleagues decided to investigate how excessive drinking might impact our risk of developing atrial fibrillation, or arrhythmic beating of the heart myocardial infarction, or heart attack and congestive heart failure, a chronic condition in which the heart cannot effectively push blood through the arteries and circulatory system to the body’s other organs and tissues.  For data, Marcus and his colleagues turned to the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project’s California State Ambulatory Surgery Databases, Emergency Department Databases and State Inpatient Databases. They looked at California residents, 21 or older, who had been hospitalized anytime between 2005 and 2009.  All told, Marcus and his team analyzed the medical records of 14, 727, 591 patients.  Of these, 1. 8 percent or approximately 268, 000, had been diagnosed with alcohol abuse. Marcus said there was no specific cutoff regarding a specific amount of alcohol or time period and admitted that this was a limitation of the study.  Within the study, then, alcohol abuse was defined as instances in which a health care provider flagged a patient as having a problem with excessive alcohol use, either ”acutely”   showing up for an appointment drunk, for example    or chronically    such as having an addiction or reliance on alcohol, explained Marcus. According to Dr. Scott Krakower, assistant unit chief of psychiatry at Zucker Hillside Hospital in New Hyde Park, New York, alcohol abuse is generally not dependence. Instead, it’s when ”you’re using it excessively at times and it’s getting in the way of functioning.” ”Abuse doesn’t necessarily lead to a pattern where you use it every day and you’re developing a tolerance or developing withdrawal symptoms,” said Krakower, who was not involved in the study. He added that alcohol abuse is when ”you start having problems with alcohol it might affect you physically, but it can also have social implications and psychological implications,” such as trouble with relationships or problems at work. Some heart risks double, In surveying the data on millions of patients, Marcus and his colleagues discovered that alcohol abuse was associated with atrial fibrillation, heart attack and heart failure.  Specifically, they found that alcohol abuse was associated with a doubled risk of atrial fibrillation, a 1.  higher risk of heart attack and a 2.  increased risk of congestive heart failure.  ”It didn’t matter if you had a conventional risk factor for these diseases or not. In every case, alcohol abuse increased the risk,” Marcus said. That said, Marcus and his colleagues discovered that the number of people who would develop either atrial fibrillation, heart attack or heart failure in three years was much higher if they had an established risk factor and abused alcohol. They also compared alcohol abuse to the conventional risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood pressure and diabetes. ”In general, if someone abused alcohol, it appeared to increase the risk to a similar magnitude to other conventional risk factors,” Marcus said. Eliminating alcohol abuse would result in over 73, 000 fewer atrial fibrillation cases, 34, 000 fewer heart attacks and 91, 000 fewer patients with congestive heart failure in the US alone, the researchers estimated. Motivation to quit, When it comes to helping patients with alcohol abuse, Krakower said, primary care doctors can use the latest    guidance tools to screen patients and ”see if a person has a problem with alcohol and from there determine what level of intervention is necessary.” From there, Krakower said, treatment options include motivational interviewing, a type of therapy in which the goal is for a patient to ”find some motivation to quit.” There’s also group therapy,   therapy techniques and, of course, Alcoholics Anonymous. Still there are nuances when it comes to drinking. ”We have an understanding (by the American Heart Association) that a glass of wine a day for women and two glasses of wine a day for men are good,” Steinbaum said. ”What is a glass? Four to 6 ounces.”  Yet if you go out to dinner and order a glass of wine, she said with a laugh, ”it’s like 12 ounces!” The exact equation of how much is too much has never really been answered, and ”part of the reason for that is metabolism is different in everyone,” Steinbaum said. Metabolism of alcohol is slower for women than for men, and individual fat distribution and muscle mass also play into how quickly alcohol is metabolized.  ”It becomes a very individual thing,” she said. ”The American Heart Association has given us very conservative guidelines, saying if you’re going to drink, this is how much but the big picture is alcohol in excess    and excess is more than a very minimal amount    is bad for your heart.” Still, no matter the characteristics of any individual patient, excessive alcohol is an important risk factor for atrial fibrillation and heart failure, Marcus said: ”Increasing awareness of this both among practitioners and individuals may actually reduce or prevent those important diseases.”');

At a press conference on Monday, an emotional Kubiak said that he was retiring from coaching because the demands of the job were becoming too much for him. ”Coaching is a very demanding business,” he said. ”Tough business. And I’ve always prided myself. You know, I’ve been a head coach for 10 years. And each of us as coaches. .. we all have a routine. We all have a way we go about doing things, and I’ve had my routine for a long time. And I’ve always taken a lot of pride that I could coach a football team, be there for the players, be there for the coaches, be there for the organization, do a game plan, call some plays on Sunday. I’ve always taken a lot of pride in the fact that I could do all of those things. ”But this year I haven’t been able to do that. It’s been tough. And for the first time I’ve had to tell myself, ’Hey, you can’t do that anymore. ’” Kubiak, 55, has had more than one health scare in his career. He missed Denver’s game on October 13 against the San Diego Chargers because of a complex migraine condition. When he was head coach of the Houston Texans, Kubiak suffered a transient ischemic attack    commonly known as a      when he collapsed during a game in 2013. Kubiak said he didn’t immediately start thinking of retirement after his medical emergency in October. ”That was obviously an episode that took place, and I’ve had a couple in the last four years, but it wasn’t like, ’OK, this is something that I can’t handle,’” he said. ”I wouldn’t say that. It was a struggle for me throughout the course of the year just keeping up with the things that I normally do and the way I want to do them. . .. It was not one incident, but I am listening to the last few years.” Broncos general manager John Elway said Kubiak approached him about a week ago to talk about stepping down. Elway said that Kubiak, a Broncos teammate in their playing days, asked him to have a conversation as his friend instead of as his boss. Elway said he has mixed emotions about Kubiak leaving and acknowledged he checked to see whether he would change his mind and come back. But as a friend, Elway said he understood Kubiak’s decision. ”In the long run, it’s the right thing for Gary, and I think that’s the most important thing,” Elway said. Kubiak was   in his two seasons as Denver’s coach. Last season, Kubiak led Denver to a   win in Super Bowl 50 in February against the Carolina Panthers. Following the win, however, the Broncos took a step back. Quarterback Peyton Manning retired, and his backup, Brock Osweiler, left for the Houston Texans. That left the Broncos with Trevor Siemian, a   draft pick in 2015, to start their title defense. The Broncos finished this season   and didn’t reach the playoffs.

Don’t worry about it.”  So far he seems intent on following through. Congressional Republicans are working on a   plan that in practice would benefit the   . And Trump’s pick of spending hawk Mick Mulvaney to head the Office of Budget and Management suggests that government programs may indeed be slashed to make such tax cuts palatable to fiscal conservatives.   Democratic lawmakers representing liberal parts of America habitually denounce this sort of thing: Spending reductions combined with tax cuts benefiting upper incomes. The question is, ”should they?” and the answer is ”no.” The blue states should take the money and run.   The time has come for liberals to recognize that the Republican agenda    which they have little control over anyway    can work to their advantage. Who gets the least return on the money they send to Washington? The economically successful blue states. Which states most depend on federal spending?  The poorer red ones.   Most of the proposed federal tax reforms would leave more wealth in the affluent blue states. They could capture some of it through their own taxes and economic activity unleashed by residents with more money in their pockets. Repealing Obamacare alone would deliver tax cuts totaling $346 billion over 10 years, every penny going to households making $200, 000 or more. Interesting that the 12 states with the largest percentage of such households all voted for Hillary Clinton.  No more universal health coverage?  Not necessarily. Massachusetts has Romneycare, a wildly popular   system that served as a model for the Affordable Care Act.  Insurers there expect little upheaval from an Obamacare repeal.   Massachusetts, by the way, has the strongest economy in the country, according to Governing magazine. California’s   insurance exchange is in good shape, notes Nicholas Bagley, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School.  California could simply adopt its own individual mandate as Obamacare does. Requiring everyone to buy coverage (or pay a fine) brings healthy people into the insurance pools. Having the young and hearty subsidize the sick and elderly keeps the pools stable. Connecticut, New York, Oregon and Washington are in especially good positions to do likewise, Bagley says. Trump’s choice of Scott Pruitt, a   denialist, to head the Environmental Protection Agency alarms environmentalists. So does Peter Navarro as head of a new White House trade council.  Navarro has accused NASA of ”politically correct environmental monitoring” of climate change through its   satellites.  No matter.  ”If Trump turns off the satellites, ” Gov. Jerry Brown said, ”California will launch its own damn satellite.” Given California’s lead in confronting climate change, we can well believe that Brown, who heads the world’s fifth biggest economy, would follow through on that promise.  You can bet that the work to build the satellites would almost all land in California.  In 2004, California set   standards higher than the federal government’s.  Twelve other states followed California’s lead and after an unsuccessful suit to stop the stricter standards, the auto industry came around.   In 2010, California required that 33 percent of its electricity come from renewable energy sources by 2020. It was recently raised to 50 percent by 2030. Now 30 states have renewable energy requirements.  ”  ” is a   approach to cutting emissions of   greenhouse gases. When Congress failed to pass    legislation, California set up its own system. As of this writing, 10 states have done likewise.  This isn’t just environmental  . It is economic development. Almost 60 percent of all   venture capital in the United States ends up in California.  The federal income tax has been called a   tax because the higher incomes tend to cluster in Democratic strongholds. What’s especially unfair about this is the federal tax code does not account for cost of living, which is highest in the elite coastal cities.   Someone making $90, 000 in Houston would have to pull in $162, 000 to live as well in San Francisco, according to BankRate’s calculator.  Yet, all else being equal, the San Franciscan pays far more taxes to the federal government than the Houstonian. There’s no reason why   states can’t get together and solve problems, including local challenges and international ones like climate change. For the richer blue states, a reduced federal tax burden would leave them with the added means to address these challenges.  And the nicest part: They can spend the money at home.');

Three people who’d been sitting in the section of the courtroom reserved for friends and family of the victims walked out while Roof spoke. One said, ”This is all crap,” as he left. Roof, wearing a gray knit sweater and speaking so softly that people in the courtroom strained to hear him, told jurors to disregard the arguments his attorneys made in the earlier phase of the trial. ”Anything you heard from my lawyers in the last phase, I ask you to forget it,” he said. ”That’s the last thing.” Prosecutor details Roof’s jailhouse journal, Last month jurors convicted Roof of federal murder and hate crimes charges for the June 2015 massacre at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston.  Now the white supremacist who killed nine people at the historically black church is representing himself in court as the jury decides whether he will face life in prison or the death penalty. Assistant US Attorney Nathan Williams argued Wednesday that a number of factors show Roof deserves a death sentence. Among them: the avowed white supremacist’s motive, his lack of remorse and the shooting’s impact on the victims’ families. ”The defendant didn’t stop after shooting one or four or five people. That’s why this case is worse,” Williams said. ”He killed because of the color of their skin. He thought they were less as people. He wanted to magnify and incite violence.” The prosecutor presented new evidence, including a jailhouse journal that he said was written six weeks after Roof’s arrest.  ”I do not regret what I did,” the journal entry said, according to Williams. ”I am not sorry. I have not shed a tear for the innocent people I killed. I do feel sorry for the innocent white children forced to live in this sick county. I do feel sorry for the innocent white people that are killed daily at the hands of the lower races. I have shed a tear of   for myself. I feel pity that I had to do what I did in the first place. I feel pity that I had to give up my life because of a situation that should never have existed.” The journal entry echoes racist statements from Roof that prosecutors presented earlier in the trial.  But the jailhouse writings reveal something significant, Williams argued. Roof, the prosecutor said, is capable of remorse    but felt none for his crimes.  Family, friends of victims testify, Also on Wednesday, the jury began hearing from people who lost relatives or friends in the massacre. Jennifer Pinckney, widow of the Rev. Clementa Pinckney,  was in a nearby room with a daughter when the shooting occurred. She testified about her relationship with her husband and about the shooting.  When police arrived, a female officer told the daughter they were going to play a game, Pinckney said. The officer encouraged the girl to put her head on her shoulder and keep her eyes closed.  But Jennifer Pinckey was unable to avoid catching a glimpse of the scene. She said she was walking to the door when she saw blood on the floor.  ”I felt sick,” she said. ”I leaned over and they rushed me out.” She believes she survived to continue her husband’s legacy. ”He did so much. And he was so many things to so many people,” she said. Some of the most emotional testimony came from the Rev. Anthony Thompson, whose wife, Myra, was killed. ”Gone. What am I here for if she’s gone? There’s nothing left for me to do now. The person I live for is gone,” he said before only his weeping could be heard in the courtroom. At one point, Roof objected to   members testifying, saying too many people were speaking. The judge denied his objection. Some family members of victims have appeared torn over whether Roof should be sentenced to death. Federal death row, Roof also is scheduled to be tried on state murder charges, for which he could also be sentenced to death. Only three federal inmates have been executed in the United States since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988 after a   moratorium: • Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh on June 11, 2001, six years after he killed 168 people. • Juan Raul Garza on June 19, 2001, eight years after he was convicted of running a marijuana drug ring and killing three people. • Louis Jones on March 18, 2003, eight years after he kidnapped and murdered    Army Pvt. Tracie McBride. Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was the last person to get a federal death sentence.

The Palestinian, Abdel Fattah   21, was one of two men accused of stabbing another Israeli soldier in the West Bank city of Hebron in March. Charges were brought against Sgt. Elor Azaria after video footage emerged showing him shooting Sharif in the head as he lay on the ground, injured and already subdued.  The second Palestinian suspect had already been shot dead. The case against Azaria has divided opinion among the Israeli public, politicians and members of the military, and focused attention on the military’s code of ethics. The shooting came at the height of a wave of Palestinian stabbing and ramming attacks, amid criticism that Israeli soldiers were too quick to pull the trigger in response, often killing the assailants. Human rights organizations say Israeli soldiers rarely face discipline for violence against Palestinians. Azaria became the lightning rod for that criticism. Hundreds of supporters protested on Azaria’s behalf outside the Tel Aviv courtroom where the trial was held, and senior politicians have called for him to be pardoned.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday added his voice to those in favor of a pardon. On his Facebook page, Netanyahu wrote, ”(T) his is a difficult and painful day    first and foremost for Elor, his family, many citizens and parents of soldiers, among them me.” But the Israeli minister of defense said that the military would respect the verdict even if there were those who didn’t like it. Azaria was serving in Hebron, a majority Palestinian area in the West Bank, when he shot Sharif. The Israeli soldier who had been attacked suffered a minor injury. According to the Israel Defense Forces, Azaria arrived at the scene about 11 minutes after the attack, cocked his rifle and shot Sharif in the head, killing him. Azaria denied the charges against him. But a   panel of military judges was unanimous in finding him guilty of manslaughter and improper conduct. Packed courtroom, At the heart of the case was the motivation for the soldier’s actions. Azaria’s defense argued he felt his life was in danger, while the prosecution contended he was motivated by malice and vengeance. In a lengthy explanation before the verdict was delivered, the judges rejected all the defense arguments. The head judge, Col. Maya Heller, said that Azaria was an ”unreliable” witness and that his defense witnesses were also problematic. She called the shooting ”needless.” Azaria’s attorneys have promised to appeal the conviction.  About 50 people packed Courtroom A inside the heavily guarded Ministry of Defense as they waited for the verdict to be read.  On one side of the aisle sat Azaria’s family. On the other sat the media. Four members of the prosecution, dressed in uniform, waited across from Azaria’s defense team, dressed in suits.  Family members gave Azaria reassuring hugs and pats on the back. His mother held him tightly. Emotional scenes followed when the verdict was finally announced. After the judges walked out, Azaria’s mother screamed, ”You should be ashamed of yourselves.”  Protesters chant, ’Our soldier, the hero’  Across the street from the Ministry of Defense compound, several hundred supporters gathered behind a police security barrier.  They danced and cheered, shouting, ”Our soldier, the hero.”  Some waved Israeli flags and homemade signs that read, ”Today: Azaria Tomorrow: Your son.” Other signs said, ”The nation is with you!” The IDF said in a statement that it respected the court verdict and would study its implications, while giving Azaria and his family all the support they need. ”The IDF judicial system will continue to act towards revealing the truth, with independence and professionalism, in any case of suspected wrongdoing by the IDF and its soldiers,” the statement said. But others, mostly politicians on the right, have argued that Azaria’s actions were justified and that he should never have faced prosecution for killing a terror suspect. Naftali Bennett, the Israeli education minister and Jewish Home party leader, called for an ”immediate” pardon in a post on Facebook, saying the process had been ”contaminated from the start.” Miri Regev, Israel’s culture and sports minister, said she would ”work to pardon” the convicted soldier. ”This was a trial that should never have begun,” Regev, a former brigadier general and spokeswoman for the IDF, wrote in a Facebook post.  ’Positive step’ However, human rights groups hailed the verdict. In a statement, Amnesty International said the conviction was ”a rare occurrence in a country with a long record of using excessive and unwarranted force,” and that it ”offers a small glimmer of hope amid the rampant impunity for unlawful killings” in the Palestinian territories. Sari Bashi, Israel advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, said, ”Today’s conviction is a positive step toward reining in excessive use of force by Israeli soldiers against Palestinians.” Rights organization Adalah    the Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel said the conviction was ”the exception to the rule and stands unique in the long history of impunity enjoyed by Israeli armed forces.”');

The Obama administration, citing US intelligence sources, has accused Russia of orchestrating the hacking of emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta in an attempt to influence the election’s outcome.  The administration says it is ”100 percent certain” about Russian involvement, but   Donald Trump has frequently cast doubt on the veracity of the claims.  In an interview that aired Tuesday on Fox News’ ”Hannity,” Assange was asked if WikiLeaks’ source of the hacked material was ”Russia or anyone associated with Russia.” ”Our source is not a state party. So the answer    for our interactions    is no,” Assange told anchor Sean Hannity from his quarters at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he has lived under diplomatic protection since 2012.  Pressed on the source of the emails leaked by WikiLeaks in the weeks and months leading up to the November election, Assange repeated, ”Our source is not the Russian government. It is not state parties.” He was not asked directly if he believed Russia orchestrated the hacking. What Trump tweets vs. What Trump means, Palin: All is forgiven, Reacting to the Hannity interview, 2008 US vice presidential candidate and   Fox News contributor Sarah Palin, once a vociferous opponent of WikiLeaks, posted an apology to Assange on Facebook.  ”This important information (the emails) that finally opened people’s eyes to democrat candidates and operatives would not have been exposed were it not for Julian Assange,” she wrote.  ”I apologize for condemning Assange when he published my infamous (and proven noncontroversial, relatively boring) emails years ago. ”Julian, I apologize.” Trump weighed in on Twitter on Wednesday morning, saying ”Julian Assange said ’a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta    why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info!” As with Palin’s   the  ’s citation of the WikiLeaks founder represents a markedly different attitude toward the whistleblowing organization.  CNN’s KFile uncovered a 2010 interview with Trump, in which Fox News anchor Brian Kilmeade brought up the topic of WikiLeaks. At the time, WikiLeaks had published hundreds of thousands of classified documents and videos that were leaked to the organization by Pfc Chelsea Manning, known at the time as Pfc Bradley Manning. Speaking on camera to preview Kilmeade’s radio show,  Trump said: ”I think it’s disgraceful, I think there should be like death penalty or something,” during the quick exchange.  Assange denies contact with Putin, Trump campaign, Assange also denied talking to Russian President Vladimir Putin, his surrogates or anyone associated with the Trump campaign.  He suggested that President Barack Obama was ”acting like a lawyer” with the hacking allegations. ”If you look at most of his statements, he doesn’t say . .. WikiLeaks obtained its information from Russia, worked with Russia.” He said the content of the emails that WikiLeaks published was germane to the US election and the concerns of the electorate, and dominated much of the election cycle in the weeks leading up to November 8.  ”Was (the leaked information) influential? Did it have a lot of influence? Statistically, yes. It was the No. 1 topic on Facebook throughout October. The No. 1 (political) topic on Twitter, also, throughout October.  ”Did it change the outcome? Who knows. It’s absolutely impossible to tell.” Trump says he has inside information on hacking, Assange open to publishing Trump leaks if available, Assange also told Hannity he would have ”absolutely” released information about Trump and his campaign if he had received it.  He added that the White House’s ”dramatic response,” directly accusing Russia of orchestrating the hacks, is an attempt to ”delegitimize” Trump’s presidency, something he believes the defeated party will continue to do.  ”(The Democratic Party) will seize on this and harp on it for the next four years,” he said.

Schumer was hoping to be the new Democratic Senate majority leader, working with Hillary Clinton in the White House. Instead, he is leading the Trump opposition. The former would have been more fun, he conceded, but he says being minority leader now is ”more important.” Here’s how he described a recent phone conversation with Donald Trump: ”I said, ’Mr.   you went after both the Democratic and Republican establishments when you ran you were an   change candidate. But by your Cabinet picks and your early pronouncements, you seem to be embracing your timeworn,   hard right,’” he recalled. ”If you do that, your presidency will not come close to being a success,” he told Trump. For Schumer, success will be even more complicated. He has to walk a very fine line between when to work with Trump, and when to oppose him. Schumer describes it as ”accountability.” ”The only way we’re going to work with him is if he moves completely in our direction and abandons his Republican colleagues,” Schumer said. Schumer: ’We’re not compromising for its own sake’ ” percent of the time, we’ll be holding his feet to the fire, holding him accountable. But we’re Democrats, we’re not going to just oppose things to oppose them,” he added. Schumer started his congressional career in the House in 1981, and served there until successfully defeating longtime Republican Sen. Alfonse D’Amato in 1998. He climbed the Democratic ranks as a fierce partisan and prolific fundraiser, but in recent years turned his attention to also becoming a successful legislator who can work across the aisle. He played a key role in crafting bipartisan Senate immigration reform in 2013, though the bill stalled in the House and never became law. Schumer loves being the center of deal making, a lot like the incoming president.   ”Well, here’s the problem. The Republicans in the Senate and the House have been run by a hard right group,” said Schumer. Schumer: I wish we hadn’t triggered ’nuclear option’ But what about now that they have a dealmaker in the White House? ”Look, we’re going to look at the specifics,” Schumer said. ”And on the overwhelming bunch of it, particularly given who he’s chosen as his Cabinet people, we’re going to have to oppose him because we just disagree in principle.”  ”Of course I’d like to make a deal,” he added. Many progressives scoff at the notion of Schumer even considering any form of compromise with Trump. Democracy for America, a leading progressive group, said: ”Democratic leaders from Chuck Schumer down need to stop playing footsie with Trump and pretending we can find.” Schumer’s response: ”We’re playing no footsie. My views are exactly the same as Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.”  ”If we can work with him and be true to our principles, we’re not going to reject him. But overall, we’re sticking to our principles,” he said.  The two New Yorkers have a history. Schumer says he doesn’t know Trump well, but he was one Schumer’s of early political donors. Schumer confirmed New York Post reporting that the   told him he likes him better than GOP leaders.  The new Democratic leader said he wasn’t surprised, but also not flattered. ”When you get to be in my position, people do tend to want to flatter you and you’ve got to take it with a grain of salt,” he said. Trump is hardly Schumer’s only concern. He’s also going to be the de facto leader of the movement to fix the defeated Democratic Party. Schumer confirms Trump told him he likes him better than Republicans, ”What we have to do is look at this election in the eye and see what we did wrong. I think we know what we did wrong. We have always been a party with a   economic message that talks about helping the middle class and people who want to get to the middle class get there more easily. We didn’t have that in this election,” Schumer said. ”So that even though Trump’s positions were much further away from where the middle class is and what they want, he seemed to be the person talking to them.” The New York Democrat says he will help his party craft what he calls a ”focused and   message.” ”And here’s the good news. Some people say, ’Which direction do you go in? The old Obama coalition or the new blue collar?’ If we have a   economic message, it unites our party. It unites Joe Manchin (a West Virginia moderate) to Bernie Sanders (a Vermont liberal) both of whom are on my leadership team,” Schumer said.  ”It unites the   worker in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the college student paying her loans in Los Angeles, the single mom in Harlem who’s on minimum wage,” he said, seeming to take the message for a  . It may be just the task for the man who put himself on the political map in the1980s by being media savvy. It was then that he realized that Sundays were a great day to make news (especially the New York Times) so he started holding regular Sunday news conferences. In the 1990s, one of the running jokes in Washington was that the most dangerous place in to be in the District was between Schumer and a television camera (Schumer says it was originally former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole’s line after Schumer used his publicity prowess to push through the Brady gun law). But that’s no longer true. Over the past several years, Schumer has tried to be more disciplined. He’s more likely to either be on his cell phone in the Capitol hallways, or pretend to be, in order to avoid talking to reporters, ”In the early days, the press was a very good way to bring out problems that needed to be fixed. Now, I have other levers of power, so I’m hardly inaccessible. And you can say a lot of bad things about Chuck Schumer and accessibility is never going to be one of them,” Schumer said with a knowing laugh. The same goes for authenticity. Though he proudly declared that he bought a new suit for his first day as leader, he is clearly still the same rumpled guy who slept for   years on a mattress next to the kitchen in a rundown group house owned by former Rep. George Miller. He now lives in an apartment, which is why he told us he is excited to have a large balcony outside his Capitol office. ”We’re going to try to find out if we can have barbeques,” Schumer said with genuine excitement. After a few more minutes, the New Yorker told us he had to get back to work. After all, he laughed, he can’t spend all his time doing press.');

Trump suggested that intelligence officials postponed an ” ’intelligence’ briefing on   ’Russian hacking’ ” that they were set to deliver to him this week because they might need more time ”to build a case.” He called the alleged delay ”very strange.” Trump tweeted Wednesday, ”Julian Assange said ’a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta’   why was DNC so careless?

Top US intelligence officials have been scheduled to brief Trump on the full report on Russian hacking President Barack Obama ordered once it was completed, but the meeting was not set to take place until later in the week, according to US officials. The meeting was never scheduled for Tuesday, as even Obama has yet to receive the   briefing on the Russian hacking, one US official said. And a US intelligence official told CNN that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper was never scheduled to be in New York City, where Trump is, on Tuesday    and was perplexed about the ”delay” Trump claimed was taking place. Trump on Tuesday did receive a classified intelligence briefing    the Presidential Daily Briefing    which Trump has elected to receive only sporadically. But it did not dive deeply into the Russian hacking. WikiLeaks’ Assange: Russia didn’t give us emails, US officials briefed on the matter said Clapper, National Security Agency Director Adm. Mike Rogers, FBI Director James Comey and CIA Director John Brennan are scheduled to attend the meeting with Trump providing him details on the Russian hacking. While Obama met with the heads of US intelligence agencies in his first weeks as   Trump has yet to do so eight weeks after he was elected, which US officials said was due to Trump’s scheduling conflicts. Instead, the   has repeatedly questioned their assessment of Russian cyber activity. Before the election, when 17 US intelligence agencies issued a public statement concluding that Russia orchestrated the hack of the Democratic National Committee, Trump immediately cast doubt on those conclusions, arguing it was impossible to distinguish between a Russian government operative and ”somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.” After Obama then slapped a series of sanctions on Russia, Trump issued a statement calling for the country to ”move on to bigger and better things” and then tweeted praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin for not retaliating against the sanctions. Trump continued his skepticism on New Year’s Eve, telling reporters once again that it ”could be somebody else.” ”I know a lot about hacking. And hacking is a very hard thing to prove,” he said. He added that he also knows ”things that other people don’t know, so they can’t be sure of the situation.” On Tuesday, Russia again denied intervening in the US election campaign.  Reacting to a US intelligence official who told CNN the administration traced the hack to specific keyboards, which featured Cyrillic characters, Kremlin spokesman Dimitri Peskov said: ”I don’t understand what this means exactly but Cyrillic characters can be used everywhere.”  ”Once again I reject any possibility that official Russia can be involved in any way,” he added.  In December, Peskov said it was ”indecent” of the US to ”groundlessly” accuse Russia of intervention in the US election campaign.');

The Russian destroyer Admiral Tributs and the sea tanker Boris Butomato, arrived in Manila on Tuesday for what the Philippine Navy termed a goodwill visit. Philippine Navy public affairs officer Lued Lincuna said there would be no joint exercises in the next five days, however, the idea of future joint exercises is under discussion. According to a report from Russia’s   Sputnik News, Russian Navy Rear Adm. Eduard Mikhailov said the Russian ships would be conducting joint exercises with Philippine forces to fight maritime piracy and terrorism. The Sputnik report termed the exercises ”an unprecedented    contact” between Russia and the Philippines. A report from the Russian website RT. com, however, said the ”Russian marines are expected to discuss and share tactics” with an eye toward future joint exercises. Any snap naval exercises between the two are unlikely, said Carl Schuster, a professor at Hawaii Pacific University and former director of operations at the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center. He said the Russian Navy uses a unique signaling system which makes communication difficult with other navies when operating in the close proximity needed in exercises. ”Maneuvering naval ships in close proximity can lead to costly collisions if there is any misunderstanding about the signaled maneuver and speed,” Schuster said in an email to CNN. The Philippines is a former US territory and longtime US ally whose ties with Washington have become strained since President Rodrigo Duterte took office. Duterte has said his country could look to Russia for military support, including arms purchases, as relations with Washington have soured. Mikhailov said Russia would look to increase involvement in the South China Sea, where islands and shoals are subject to competing claims from China, the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam and Brunei. But Mikailov said Russia could be involved in joint military exercises that involved not only the Philippines, but also China and Malaysia, according to the Sputnik report. ”Maintaining the involvement of these regional partners is crucial for ensuring the stability of the South China Sea, where competing territorial claims continue to fuel geopolitical tensions,” the Sputnik report said. Tensions in the area have ratcheted up in the past two years as China has reclaimed land in massive dredging operations in the Spratly Islands, turning sandbars into islands equipped with airfields, weapons systems, ports and lighthouses. Russian ships, including the Admiral Tributs, staged joint   exercises with Chinese units in the South China Sea last September. China continued to highlight its South China Sea presence this week, announcing that its lone aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, had been conducting drills involving   fighter jets and helicopters, according to a report from the   Xinhua news agency. The agency’s website featured a gallery of photos from the exercises. The South China Sea are the latest in a cruise of the Liaoning that saw it venture into the open Pacific for the first time in late December. The Pacific leg of the cruise took the carrier and its escorts past Japan and Taiwan, both of which took notice. ”The threat of our enemy is growing day by day. We should always be maintaining our combat alertness,” said Taiwan Defense Minister Feng  . ”We are taking notice of this event, which indicates China is expanding its ability to engage in maritime warfare,” Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said.');

And like many   geologic discoveries, it began with the human drive to   mine natural resources. ’ ’   ”Calling Zealandia a continent is more of a formality and mostly   a scientific interest,” said study   Vaughan Stagpoole, a   geophysicist and head of the marine geoscience department at    a New     research institute. ’ ’   ”In terms of the economic benefits” like minerals, oil, and gas,   he said, ”that was established a while ago.” ’ ’   And yet New Zealand and New Caledonia, a French territory, are   only just beginning to establish what’’s down there other than a   lot of continental crust; Stagpoole says it’’s a vast, mostly   unexplored, and ”extreme frontier”  —   one that could hide untold   riches. ’ ”   Here’s how scientists found Zealandia and why it’s so important. ” ’  ’ ”   The  marked the beginning of New Zealand’s offshore drilling   efforts and the discovery of the continent Zealandia. ” ”   Since that time, the country’s  per capita has since grown to 30 percent that   of US output, and it’s a significant economic boon for the island   nation. In fact, the government now leases about 200 wells and   pulls in  worth of royalties a year. ” ’   ”Oil remains a significant export earner in New Zealand and   natural gas is a vital input to industry, electricity generation   and is used in more than 300, 000 homes,” Simon Bridges, New   Zealand’’s energy and resources minister, said in . (Though we’’ll note that many locals are     with   the  posed by offshore drilling.) ’ ’   Oil prospectors and geologists alike in the  wondered if there might be more continental   crust  —   and the oil it conceals  —   lurking deep below the ocean   around New Zealand and New Caledonia. ’ ”   So in the early ’70s, they began drilling samples from the ocean   bottom and pulling them up. ” ’   Lo and behold, the rocks seemed continental in nature, and   remarkably similar from one region to the next. Evidence for more   and larger tracts of continental crust hidden on the ocean bottom   mounted with each new expedition. ’ ’   Looking at the data in 1995,    a geophysicist at the University of California at Santa Barbara,   coined the term ”Zealandia.” ’ ’ ’ ”   Luyendyk never intended Zealandia to be a new continent’s name. ” ’   Rather, he used it to describe New Zealand, New Caledonia, and   the growing number of submerged chunks of crust that broke off a   region of  a 200    supercontinent. ’ ’   ”The reason I came up with this term is out of convenience,”   Luyendyk previously told Business Insider. ”They’’re pieces of the   same thing when you look at Gondwana. So I thought, ’’Why do you   keep naming this collection of pieces as different things? ’’” ’ ’  ’ ’   At around the same time Luyendyk wrote down ”Zealandia,” New   Zealand joined a United Nations treaty called the  (UNCLOS) which helped spur   the continent’’s discovery. ’ ’   Importantly, UNCLOS defines five maritime zones  —   one of which   hinges on a ”continental” definition (more on this in a moment). ’ ’  ’ ’   The ”territorial sea” zone extends about 12 miles offshore.   Countries get tight control over most things that happen there,   including drilling, fishing, boating, flights, and immigration. ’ ’   Between 12 and 200 miles, there’’s the ”economic zone” where   Stagpoole says ”vessels can pass through without any permission”   yet the country retains many drilling and fishing rights. ’ ”   Beyond 200 miles, it’s a sort of a Wild West. ” ’   However, a piece of that treaty called ”” says that   a nation can lay claim to a continental shelf’’s drilling and   mining rights  —   if they can prove it’’s connected to their nation. ’ ’   So New Zealand and other nations set out to explore just that in   the late 1990s through the early 2000s, came back with a pile of   evidence, and the UN agreed with its final border claims in 2004. ’ ’   It was a huge seafloor land grab for New Zealand, in that the   nation significantly expanded its resource extraction rights   (area between the yellow and red borders, below). ’ ’  ’ ’   The effort amounted to a lot of drilling samples, satellite   imagery, seismic scans, and other information about the seafloor   of Zealandia. ’ ’   Stagpoole says this data eventually led to further scientific   studies, including  on the Tasman Frontier: ”a vast submerged   continental fragment of over 3, 000, 000 sq km [1. 16 million square   miles] between Australia, New Zealand and New Caledonia.” ’ ”   That work begged the question: Are these all just Gondwana’s   continental fragments, or all part of an unrecognized continent? ” ’  ’ ”   Stagpoole and his colleagues  of Zealandia’s continent status in the     2017 issue of GSA Today, a Geological Society of   America journal. ” ’   ”I think they’’ve put together a solid collection of evidence   that’’s really thorough,” said Luyendyk, who wasn’’t involved in   the new study. ”I don’’t see that there’’s going to be a lot of   pushback, except maybe around the edges.” ’ ’   Despite the fact that New Zealand has been selling off drilling   permits to Zealandia with its ”” program since 2012, Stagpoole says no one is exactly   sure what Zealandia has to offer, or where. ’ ’  ’ ’   ”We’’re still trying to understand the tectonic history,”   Stagpoole said. ”New Caledonia, Germany, Australia, and other   nations are regularly exploring this region to understand the   question about how continental crust is formed, and understand   the geologic history of this particular continental crust.” ’ ’   He said it will take more    expeditions to figure out   what treasures Zealandia hides  —   likely pockets of oil, precious   metals, and other extractable resources. ’ ’   ”If you plotted all of the scientific ship trips so far, they can   be hundreds of kilometers apart,” he said. ”There are huge gaps   in our understanding of what’’s down there.” ’ ”   For now, Stagpoole said it’s a technology and   issue:   getting enough   instruments deployed on enough ships. ” ’   ”This is extreme frontier,” he said. ”As we get better at   exploring the deep oceans, these things may become more   economic.” ’ ’Zealandia is a new and mostly submerged. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’');

The verdict exacerbated tensions between the IDF and   Israeli politicians who excoriated the military for pursuing the case in the first place. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanhayu, Education Minister Naftali Bennett, and other Israeli politicians, have even called for Azaria’s pardon. When the verdict came down, the Netanyahu government was still reeling from the Obama administration’s decision in late December to abstain from vetoing a UN Security Council resolution reaffirming   international consensus: that Israel’s   in the territories it has occupied since 1967 is illegal under international law. (Historically, U. S. officials have massaged the issue by calling settlements “obstacles to peace” and refrained from explicitly referencing their illegality.) Several days later, Secretary of State John Kerry delivered a speech on Israel and Palestine also largely recapitulating U. S. policy in the region. Again, the Netanyahu government howled in protest. The Shame of Shuhada Street, Back in 1995, few could have predicted such a rift between the Unites States and its closest ally in the Middle East. In that year, the United States helped broker the Oslo II accord, in which Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) formally agreed to the terms an independent Palestinian state by 1999. The agreement also created the Palestinian Authority (PA) and split the West Bank into three separate zones: Area A, which includes almost all of the major Palestinian population centers in the West Bank but only 18 percent of the territory, governed by the PA B, where the PA has jurisdiction over civil affairs and the IDF retains control over all security matters and C, where Israel has total authority over all civil and military affairs. (The commander of the Palestinian Security forces in Jenin in Area A lamented to me how IDF incursions into his territory undermine his authority in the eyes of his own people.) When I travelled through the West Bank several months ago, it was clear that the hallmarks of the occupation —  its roadblocks and checkpoints, the separation fence and barrier wall (which both prevent terrorist attacks and asphyxiate Palestinian life) the nighttime incursions by the IDF into cities and refugee camps, the Kafkaesque bureaucracy that makes daily life for Palestinians onerous —  had taken on a perverse air of normalcy. Indeed, in the eyes of many   Israelis, and perhaps a   number of Americans, this regime is now regarded as sustainable. But even this system pales to what you’ll find in Hebron. Hebron, with its population of over 200, 000 Palestinians and under 1, 000 Jews, is governed differently than the rest of the West Bank. According to the terms of the 1997 Hebron Protocol, Israel has instituted a kind of internal partition, under which 80 percent of the city is under full control of the PA, and the other 20 percent under IDF administration Palestinians living under the IDF are subject to military law, while Israelis are subject to the normal civil code. When I asked a senior Israeli military official last week about the IDF’s efforts to prevent violence by settlers against Hebron’s Palestinian community, he told me that there has been “a major effort” to turn issues of settler violence over to the Israeli police. “They’re the body that has the legal authority to act against the radical settlers,” the official said. Hebron is also home to the Tomb of the Patriarchs, the   site in Judaism it includes both a Jewish section and a Muslim section, called the Ibrahimi Mosque. In February of 1994, Baruch Goldstein, a radical settler from a settlement abutting Hebron, walked into the Ibrahimi Mosque, took out an assault rifle, and opened fire, killing 29 people and injuring 125, all Muslims. Deadly riots between Jews and Muslims followed, and the IDF closed Shuhada Street, formerly the main commercial thoroughfare in the city, connecting the tiny Jewish quarter to the tomb. On my visit to Hebron, I found that Shuhada Street remains closed, its businesses boarded up and emptied out. Palestinians are barred from accessing the area entirely, or from even walking down the street. The IDF maintains a militarized presence in this part of Hebron, protecting the   Jews living in the city center, for whom proximity and access to the Tomb of the Patriarchs is paramount. The problem is that events in Hebron tend to reverberate far beyond the city. In June 2014, Hamas operatives from Hebron kidnapped three Israeli teenagers hitchhiking in the area they were later found buried in a shallow grave in a field near the city. The IDF, searching for the abducted men, began a violent crackdown in the West Bank, arresting hundreds. Hamas fired rockets from Gaza in response. A   war in Gaza, short but furious, broke out between Israel and Hamas. Over 2, 100 Palestinians were killed, as were 73 Israelis. The city now teeters on a very sharp edge. Hebron has been the source of many of the   “copycat” attacks that have occurred in the West Bank and Israel over the past year, the senior Israel military official told me. In fact, not only has Hebron experienced the largest number of terrorist attacks of any city in Israel and the West Bank during the period it is also home to the largest number of individuals who have committed attacks elsewhere within the West Bank and Israel over the past year, the official said. “The possibility of escalation is always there,” the military official said, especially because of Hamas’s “unique” level of strength in the city. * * * For hundreds of years, Jews have had a small, nearly uninterrupted, presence in Hebron. In August 1929, amid rising tensions between Jewish and Arab communities across British Mandate Palestine, rumors spread that Jews were planning on demolishing the   Mosque, the   site in Islam, in order to build the Third Temple. (Jews believe the Temple Mount, where the mosque now stands, is where the two great Jewish temples were once located.) On August 24, 1929, a vicious pogrom broke out in Hebron. A mob of Arabs traveled    killing 67 Jews and wounding scores, wiping out the city’s Jewish community. It would not recover until Passover, 1979, when a group of Jews —  guaranteed implicit protection by the IDF, which began occupying Hebron, along with the rest of the West Bank, in 1967 —  visited the city and refused to leave, overcoming initial government opposition to their presence. They have lived in Hebron ever since. The Hebron History Museum, located in the heart of   Hebron, dedicates an entire room to the massacre. Photos of men with pleading eyes and stumps for hands line the walls. On the day I visited the museum, Tzipi Schissel, the museum’s curator, wore a     in the Orthodox style, and socks under her sandals. On my tour of the museum, she explained that the evidence of an ancient Jewish Hebron justifies the current Jewish settlement, and militates against current Israeli policy, which severely curtails Jewish resettlement in the urban core. Schissel’s family was in Hebron in 1929. She recounted stories of the cruelty of local Arabs and the British soldiers who subsequently occupied the city. Hebron is an integral part of Israel, Schissel said. “When you go to buy something here,” she asked us, “and you look at the currency, what state does it say you’re in?” (How a Palestinian might feel about buying groceries with shekels, the Israeli currency, did not seem to cross her mind.) When we entered the section of the museum devoted to the 1929 massacre, Schissel grew quiet. Years ago, she said, a Palestinian man broke into her family’s home in Hebron. He plunged a knife into her father over and over, and she watched him bleed to death. Still, she said, she’ll never leave Hebron. It struck me that this ghastly tragedy hadn’t caused her family to flee, or question why her community chose to live under duress in fact, it only seemed to stiffen her resolve to stay. “The greater is one’s yearning for an attachment to Eretz Yisrael,” wrote Rabbi Kook, Schissel’s   “the purer his thoughts become, for they then live in the air of Eretz Yisrael, which sustains everyone who longs for the Land. ” After I left the museum, I walked down Shuhada Street, toward the Tomb of the Patriarchs. Israeli flags swelled in the distance. Hundreds of   Jews, part of a group called “Israel Is Forever,” marched down the street, bellowing into bullhorns. They stopped near the tomb and recited the traditional Mourner’s Kaddish in Hebrew. I have heard, and recited, this prayer hundreds of times, always as a dirge. Here, it sounded like a battle cry. The president of Israel Is Forever, Jacques Kupfer, is a prominent     commentator, member of the Board of Governors for the Jewish Agency, and   of World Likud, the international wing of Israel’s   Likud Party. On Facebook, Kupfer consistently referred to former President Barack Obama exclusively as “Hussein Obama. ” His group says it opposes “any further partition plan in favor of a   people and a future terrorist state. ” Later in the day, Tzipi Hotovely, Israel’s deputy foreign minister in the current   government, spoke at a special rally held by Israel is Forever. She encouraged French Jews —  who have been fleeing Europe because of increasing   —  to make aliyah, or resettle in Israel. Hotovely also does not believe in a Palestinian state, and has called for the wholesale annexation of the West Bank. The protesters gathered at the steps leading to the magnificent tomb. The bellicose crowd, emboldened by the protection of the IDF soldiers, chanted “ !  !  !  !” Their vision was so narrowly focused on the tomb that they seemed not to see the sprawling Palestinian city that surrounds them. That same evening, IDF soldiers entered   a nearby Palestinian refugee camp, on a mission to confiscate contraband weaponry. Clashes broke out, with Palestinians throwing rocks and IEDs. The IDF responded with rubber bullets and live fire, injuring 35 and killing one. After visiting the tomb, I entered Hebron’s historic Old City, first passing through a checkpoint consisting of two metal cages connected by a secure passageway, guarded by tense Ethiopian and Mizrahi IDF soldiers in an enclosed booth. The souk, or marketplace, in Hebron is typically claustrophobic, a warren of narrow alleyways and   shopkeepers. It begins one street over —  and a world away —  from Shuhada Street. In many cases, the windows of the buildings you see from the   side, fortified by mesh and metal bars, actually belong to the Palestinian families who live and work in the old city. They cannot access their own balconies, or open their own kitchen windows. And, if walking through the souk, you glance skyward, you will see heavy netting above you. Much of it sags with the weight of garbage thrown by Israeli settlers, in an attempt, local Palestinians say, to intimidate residents, and make shopkeepers’ lives impossible. Palestinians in the West Bank feel that the occupation’s ultimate aim is to drive them out of the territories. For some, merely refusing to leave one’s homeland is a way of rejecting Israeli colonialism. “My presence here in Hebron is a form of resistance,” Mohammed Mohtaseb, a Palestinian tour guide, told me. For all the conspiratorial talk I heard from Palestinians —  prominent Fatah Party members,   PA bureaucrats, and local shopkeepers alike, told me that ISIS is a   front group —  there is a powerful logic to this line of thinking. “I don’t think you can actually equate the situation in Hebron to any other city in the world,” Husam Zomlot, Strategic Affairs Advisor to PA President Mahmoud Abbas (and the next PLO Ambassador to the United States, according to recent reports) told me recently. “The overall situation, over years and years, is unbearable. ” In recent months, Zomlot said, “Hebron has been the main theater of clashes and confrontations, of disproportionate use of force by Israel. The numbers speak for themselves: youth who have been shot and killed in Hebron are, in relative terms, the largest number after Jerusalem. ” * * * In any future peace deal, the IDF would likely be required to uproot over 75, 000 Jews from the West Bank, some of them religious ideologues, from their homes near some of the holiest places in their faith. In this equation, the settlers of Hebron seem unlikely to voluntarily quit their   site. This is the paradox: The Jews of Hebron cannot leave, but neither can they stay. If the IDF withdraws —  as it must under any future peace deal —  the radical settlers of Hebron and elsewhere could face another massacre, another 1929. If the IDF stays, the   solution, threatened by settlements like Kiryat Arba, will lose whatever residual viability it may yet possess. Although Zomlot is hopeful that Hebron’s could help facilitate a political solution —  Hebronites, he said, actually have the most to gain from such a deal, given that the city is the West Bank’s economic engine —  he is pessimistic about its   prospects. “Nothing suggests that things will improve over the next year,” he said. Hebron, Gaza, Jerusalem, and most Palestinian cities are “sitting on a ticking bomb. But Hebron is the most immediate ticking bomb. ” The longer Israel occupies places like Hebron, the more difficult it will be to dislodge the settlers who reside there. And the longer the settlers are ensconced, the likelier it is that terrorist groups like Hamas will declare   war upon them, as well as Israeli civilians inside the   borders. And the greater the perception of the threat that such groups pose, the less likely Israeli troops will be to withdraw from the West Bank highlands that give Israel its strategic depth. In December 2016, then   Trump named David Friedman, a   extremist, as his next Ambassador to Israel. Trump has also promised —  threatened —  to relocate the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a highly charged move that could itself set off violence. This month, Trump’s Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, endorsed this policy during her Senate confirmation hearings. Jordan, America’s closest Arab partner in the region, has called such a move “a red line” with potentially “catastrophic implications,” according to the Associated Press. Senior Palestinian officials have even said that if such a move occurs, the PLO will revoke its official recognition of Israel, a cornerstone of the Oslo Accords. Moreover, without the moderating influence of the Obama administration, provocative settlement construction may now accelerate. In fact, after soon after President Trump took office, the Netanyahu government announced building approval for 2, 500 new housing units in the West Bank. Meanwhile, in Hebron, storm clouds continue to gather. The question is whether the world sees them.');

If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible. ” People overseas “were chopping off the heads of everybody, but more so the Christians,” he added, “so we are going to help them. ” The Coldhearted Folly of Trump’s Proposed Immigration Order, The announcement was met with immediate backlash from leaders of nearly every Christian denomination, along with those of other faiths. They argue that Trump’s actions do not reflect the teachings of the Bible, nor the traditions of the United States, and they have urged the president to let them get back to work —  many of the country’s most prominent refugee resettlement organizations are  . If so many prominent Christian leaders reject the notion that their fellow Christians should get preferential treatment, why has this become Trump’s policy? One possible answer is that these leaders don’t necessarily reflect what their flocks believe. Even if they think an open refugee policy is in line with the teachings of Christianity, lay Americans don’t necessarily feel the same way. From religious leaders’ perspectives, backlash against Trump’s immigration policy may be the most ecumenical issue in America right now. Hundreds of prominent clergy signed onto a letter condemning the “derogatory language that has been used about Middle Eastern refugees and our Muslim friends and neighbors,” calling on Trump to reinstate the refugee program. While these efforts included many progressive and mainline denomination leaders, along with an interfaith coalition of other clergy, it’s not just liberals who are pushing back against Trump. A wide range of conservative Christian leaders, along with other relief organizations, have also spoken out against the president’s decision. “Christ calls us to care for everyone, regardless of who they are and where they come from,” said Jenny Yang, the senior vice president of advocacy and policy at World Relief, the arm of the National Association of Evangelicals that provides refugee and immigration resettlement services. “That has to be a core part of our witness —  not just caring for our own, but caring for others as well. ” The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, the official body of the Church in America, also declared that it “strongly opposes” Trump’s executive orders. “We believe in assisting all those who are vulnerable and fleeing persecution, regardless of their religion,” said Bishop Joe Vásquez of Austin, Texas, in a statement. “This includes Christians, as well as Yazidis and Shia Muslims from Syria, Rohingyas from Burma, and other religious minorities. However, we need to protect all our brothers and sisters of all faiths, including Muslims. ” During his homily at a   prayer vigil on Thursday, New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan said something similar, as I wrote on Friday: “Refugees and immigrants continue to believe that this nation is still a sanctuary, as they arrive with relief and thanksgiving,” he said. “We pray they are never let down!” During his campaign, Trump won the tentative support of Samuel Rodriguez, the head of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, who later offered a prayer during Trump’s inauguration. This was an important endorsement —  Rodriguez is a vocal advocate for immigrants and their families, many of whom are part of churches represented by his organization. Responding to Trump’s order, Rodriguez told me, “We are a good nation when we are secured. We are a great nation when we are both secured and provide safety for those feeling from the most egregious circumstances. ” When asked whether he supports priority status for Christian refugees, he said, “In light of the fact that Christians are now the most persecuted religious group in the world, I would allocate 50 percent for Christians and 50 percent for other groups. ” While it is very difficult to know exactly how many Christians face persecution for their faith each year, and how their experiences compare to other groups’ Pew Research Center found that Christians faced harassment in more countries than any other religious group in 2014 —  a number closely followed by Muslims, the world’s other largest religious group. Other organizations simply haven’t chosen to be vocal on this issue. “I don’t think we’re that declarative,” said Jim Daly, the president of Focus on the Family, in an interview. He said he wants “a process that we can have confidence in that people are being checked out,” echoing President Trump’s rhetoric. But he also believes the U. S. should offer religious asylum to families. “Yazidis and Christians and even Muslims who are persecuted —  if we can verify their sincerity, and their story, as we’ve done for centuries, I think it would be wise to be open to a healthy immigration policy that allows people to flee,” he said. A small handful of Christian leaders have spoken out in favor of reducing or banning Muslims’ entry to the United States, sharing in some of Trump’s rhetoric about “radical Islamic terrorism. ”  For example: In the summer of 2015, Franklin Graham —  the son of Billy Graham and head of his father’s eponymous evangelistic organization, as well as the charitable organization Samaritan’s Purse —  wrote on Facebook: We should stop all immigration of Muslims to the U. S. until this threat with Islam has been settled. Every Muslim that comes into this country has the potential to be radicalized —  and they do their killing to honor their religion and Muhammad. This week, he commented on Trump’s executive order, telling The Huffington Post that “it’s not a biblical command for the country to let everyone in who wants to come. ” Graham may be reflecting what many Americans, including some of his fellow Christians, believe. As recently as last summer, 40 percent of Americans —  including   of Republicans and 77 percent of Trump supporters —  supported a temporary ban on Muslims coming to the United States, according to a report from the Public Religion Research Institute and the Brookings Institution. Nearly half of Americans also worry that they or their families will be victims of a terrorist attack, according to a 2015 PRRI survey. “I think they’re thinking about it through the lens of fear,” said Bill O’Keefe, a vice president at Catholic Relief Services. “Many Americans have legitimate security concerns because of what they see on television and what they believe about how dangerous the world is. ” But, he said, the way “Muslims are portrayed on television does not reflect the experience of groups like Catholic Relief Services. ” Contrary to Trump’s claims, Christians refugees have not faced unfair treatment from the U. S. government compared to Muslims. Roughly the same number of Christian and Muslim refugees have been admitted to the United States each year in recent years, according to data from the State Department. It was only in 2016, the first time in a decade, that the share of Christian refugees dipped slightly below that of Muslims, to 44 percent of overall refugees. On issues that directly affect the lives of religious minority groups, the voices of religious leaders matter. When Graham and the small handful of others like him speak out on these issues, they likely influence the faithful who follow them. It’s very possible they’ve also influenced the president of the United States toward a tacit refugee policy that puts Christians first among religious groups, to the exclusion of others. Meanwhile, the leaders who disagree with Trump will be left to keep shouting their concern. “The Christian religion is about love, and fear is actually the opposite of love,” said O’Keefe. “As Christians, we need to overcome our fear, legitimate as it may be, and act on the basis of love and concern for the poor. ”');

The latest of his signed directives, which suspends the U. S. refugee program and appears to target   nations, is intended to stop potential terrorists from entering the country —  but that’s a “coldhearted folly,” according to Graeme Wood, and it probably won’t work. Meanwhile, history suggests that the consequences of Trump’s order could be devastating for the refugees turned away. Border Costs: As for   already here, Trump’s executive orders to step up deportations of the undocumented and crack down on “sanctuary cities” are likely to be harmful to the health of immigrant children, as constant stress over the threat of deportation interferes with their physical development (as well as mental health as one reader writes, “the fear of anyone finding out I was undocumented loomed over my entire childhood”). A sad irony to this is that most Americans —  of any political background —  don’t support mass deportation, not only because of humanitarian concerns but because of the massive costs and logistical difficulties. Also costly: Trump’s   wall on the Mexican border. To pay for that massive project, the White House has floated the possibility of a tariff or a border adjustment tax. Unifying Ideologies: Vice President Pence spoke today at the March for Life, demonstrating the Trump administration’s support for one of the movements that backed him —  although Trump’s other positions, on refugees for instance, may give some members of the   movement pause. On the other hand, abortion is among several issues —  including racial justice and transgender representation —  that have caused fractures within the   movement led by the Women’s March. And while the Democratic Party works to unify its left wing, it also faces the task of reaching out to social conservatives.

Fuller’s tale is of Darwin and abolition and moral battles that led to literal ones it is also, more simply, the story of humans wrestling with insights that would change the world and their place in it. The story is evocatively told: [historian Randall] Fuller is an excellent writer, with an eye for irony and a unique ability to inject suspense into a story that is, at its core, about the mercurial nature of chromosomes. The book is also, in some ways, as limited as it is sprawling. It focuses on the intellectual elites —  and on their pettiness, and their idealism, their humanity. As for the broader “America,” though —  its everyday denizens, among them wide swathes of people who were not yet afforded the dignity of citizenry —  Fuller offers less detail.

People crouched on the street, scrawling messages on colored cardstock with Sharpie. “NO MUSLIM BAN,” some posters said. Others proclaimed “Refugees Welcome!” The protest was announced just a day before on Facebook in response to an executive order signed by President Trump on Friday. That measure restricts immigration from seven Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Sudan, Somalia, and Yemen. It also suspends the admission of all refugees for 120 days and bans all Syrian refugees indefinitely. As soon as Trump signed the order, refugees, immigrants, and   holders arriving at airports across the country were detained. Large protests ensued at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and Dulles International Airport outside Washington, and immigration lawyers flocked to the aid of the detainees. So far, federal judges in four states have issued orders blocking the government from deporting some detainees, but as my colleague Matt Ford writes, the legal battles have just begun. On this cold January afternoon, people took their protest to downtown Washington, filling Lafayette Square outside the White House. Bundled in coats and sweaters, they pushed as far as they could toward the fence separating them from Pennsylvania Avenue, repeating the mantra “No hate, no fear, refugees are welcome here” and chanting “Let them in. ” A man named Tom sprinted by me on his way to the protest, wrapped in a giant American flag. “It’s disgusting,” Tom said of the immigration order. “It’s politically misguided, but more than that, it’s morally reprehensible. ” He brought the flag as a reminder, he said, that this country was built on immigrants. Julie Looper, who’s from the Washington area, said she was mostly worried about the message the order sends to other countries. “What we’re showing the rest of the world now is we’re hating,” Looper said. “I don’t want that to be what we represent to the world. America is welcoming. We want to be welcoming. ” She and a friend were sitting on a concrete barrier, using it as a surface to write on big sheets of   cardboard. Looper held up her sign, a quote from Cher Horowitz, the main character in the 1995 movie Clueless: “It does not say R. S. V. P. on the Statue of Liberty!” For many protesters, the ban is deeply personal. Shaun Zare, a manager at UPS, has lived in America since he was 16, but he was born in Iran. His parents, who are permanent residents of the United States, are out of the country, and he’s not sure if they’ll be allowed back in. “My wedding is about four months from now,” Zare said. “So they’re not going to be able to attend if Trump’s going have this rule. ” (On Sunday evening, John Kelly, the secretary of Homeland Security, said that “lawful permanent residents” won’t be barred from entry.) Zare said he considers himself to be more American than Iranian, and that his American identity has always been about values, rather than race or political affiliation. “[Trump] is against everything that this country stands for,” Zare said, “and we are here to protest that today. ” Standing near the fence that blocked protesters from standing directly in front of the White House, a blond woman huddled with her two daughters. The woman, Mehrnoosh, was born in Tehran, but now she lives in Fairfax, Virginia. “I’m very sad,” she told me, her voice trembling. “I’ve been crying for the past few days. ” Her sister, who still lives in Iran, was supposed to come visit, but now, she said, obtaining a visa could be a challenge.     Mariam Kanna came to the protest to voice her frustration over what she calls a “disgusting” move from the Trump administration. “I think that the majority of Americans, as evidenced by President Trump losing the popular vote, are opposed to this kind of thing,” she said, holding a sign declaring herself a child of Iraqi immigrants. Kanna was born in the United States, but she’s worried for family members living abroad who might struggle to come here because of the new immigration rules. “This executive order just directly impacts my family,” she said. “I feel like my own government is rejecting me and people like me. ” As we spoke, a group of protesters began to sing the Woody Guthrie song “This Land Is Your Land. ” The words rang out, soft and low, under persistent shouts of “Let them in!” The singers directed their signs and their words to the White House, a direct appeal to President Trump: “And all around me a voice was sounding,” they sang. “This land was made for you and me. ” “I think most people probably are horrified by what’s happening, but the people at the highest level of our government seem to support this,” Kanna said, looking around. “It’s hard to see a way out right now. ”');

But in a partial   of the policy, administration officials clarified that permanent legal residents —  holders of green cards —  would mostly be exempt from the ban. “In applying the provisions of the president’s executive order, I hereby deem the entry of lawful permanent residents to be in the national interest,” Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said in a statement early Sunday evening. “Accordingly, absent the receipt of significant derogatory information indicating a serious threat to public safety and welfare, lawful permanent resident status will be a dispositive factor in our    determinations. ” Several other   Republican legislators also distanced themselves from the executive order over the weekend, as protests swelled at major American airports and cities, including Washington, D. C. Democratic lawmakers have roundly denounced the ban as a violation of American values and the Constitution’s protection against discrimination based on religion. Several, including Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Cory Booker of New Jersey, have joined the airport protests. Party leaders said dozens of Democratic members of the House and Senate would gather alongside Muslim refugees in front of the Supreme Court on Monday evening to demand that the president reverse his executive order. And in her first criticism of a specific Trump policy since her election defeat, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tweeted Sunday: “This is not who we are. ” (Her daughter, Chelsea, joined the protests in New York.) I stand with the people gathered across the country tonight defending our values  our Constitution. This is not who we are. Despite the criticism from Democrats and some Republicans, however, Trump retained support from the quarter that mattered most: GOP congressional leadership. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who had repeatedly criticized Trump’s proposed Muslim ban during the campaign, issued a statement Friday evening saying the president was “right to make sure we are doing everything possible to know exactly who is entering our country. ” “Our number one responsibility is to protect the homeland,” Ryan said. “We are a compassionate nation, and I support the refugee resettlement program, but it’s time to reevaluate and strengthen the   process. This is why we passed bipartisan legislation in the wake of the Paris attacks to pause the intake of refugees. ” Other Republicans noted that Trump’s order goes well beyond the legislation that passed the House but was never signed into law by former President Barack Obama. “The president’s executive order issued yesterday went beyond the increased vetting actions that Congress has supported on a bipartisan basis and inexplicably applied to   holders, people who are legally within our country who have followed the rules,” Representative Barbara Comstock of Virginia said. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell offered more qualified support Sunday morning in an appearance on ABC’s This Week. He backed a tightening of the vetting process for refugees, but he warned the administration to “be careful” not to create an overly broad restriction that would exclude or deter Muslims who have helped the United States in the war against terrorism. “If they’re looking to tighten the vetting process, I mean, who would be against that?” McConnell said. “But I am opposed to a religious test. The courts are going to determine whether this is too broad. ” Under   questioning from Martha Raddatz, however, the Kentucky Republican ultimately stood with the administration. “Look, the president has a lot of latitude to try to secure the country,” McConnell said. “And I’m not going to make a blanket criticism of this effort. ” Republican critics of the executive order and its implementation included three senators who refused to endorse Trump during the campaign: Jeff Flake of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine, and Ben Sasse of Nebraska. “President Trump and his administration are right to be concerned about national security, but it’s unacceptable when even legal permanent residents are being detained or turned away at airports and ports of entry,” Flake wrote on Medium. Sasse said in a statement that even though the order was technically not a Muslim ban, it was “too broad” and, as such, risked handing a recruiting victory to Islamic terrorists. In the House, Representatives Justin Amash of Michigan, Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, Comstock Elyse Stefanik of New York, Mike Coffman of Colorado, and Will Hurd of Texas were among the Republicans critical of the ban, with most of them saying it was overly broad. Many of them represent either swing districts or constituencies with large immigrant populations, or both. Many other conservatives in Congress either stayed quiet over the weekend or voiced support for the executive order. Whether the GOP opposition builds to a legislative response is far from clear. Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, said he would introduce a bill to overturn the order next week, but it will be up to McConnell whether it comes for a vote.');

Under its provisions, Trump suspended the U. S. Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days, barred the citizens of seven   countries from entering the U. S. on all but certain diplomatic visas for 90 days, and permanently blocked the admission of Syrian refugees into the United States. The order does not affect travel by U. S. citizens, whether they were born in the country or later became naturalized. The order’s sudden release and sweeping effect led to confusion and chaos at major U. S. airports as hundreds of travelers, including some lawful permanent U. S. residents with green cards, found themselves unable to enter the country. In New York, Los Angeles, Washington, D. C. and other major cities, demonstrators gathered outside international terminals to protest the executive order. Democratic members of Congress and volunteer lawyers also arrived to free people detained by U. S. customs officials. The ACLU and other legal organizations also filed lawsuits seeking temporary stays of removal in federal courts in at least four cities. Those efforts first bore fruit in the form of a   order in New York City, where federal judge Ann Donnelly granted an emergency stay of removal. In the broad order, Donnelly enjoined the federal government “from, in any manner or by any means, removing individuals with refugee applications approved by U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services as part of the U. S. Refugee Admissions Program, holders of valid immigrant and   visas, and other individuals from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen legally authorized to enter the United States. ” Donnelly did not limit the order’s scope to her jurisdiction, effectively making it a nationwide injunction. Shortly after Donnelly’s order was issued, federal judge Leonie Brinkema in Virginia issued a temporary restraining order requiring the federal government to “permit lawyers access to all legal permanent residents being detained at Dulles International Airport” and forbade U. S. officials from removing the lawsuit’s plaintiffs “for a period of 7 days from the issuance of this order. ” Unlike Donnelly’s broad injunction, Brinkema limited his order’s scope to Dulles International Airport, a major international airport in Virginia located about 30 miles outside Washington, D. C. Early Sunday morning in Boston, federal judge Allison Burroughs and federal magistrate judge Judith Dein then issued an order barring the detention as well as the removal of the same groups covered by Donnelly’s injunction. Both of their injunctions apply nationwide. Federal judge Thomas Zilly issued the fourth order on Sunday morning, granting temporary stay of removal to two John Doe plaintiffs in Washington state. In practical terms, both the Donnelly order and the   order temporarily block the federal government from removing or detaining anyone with valid immigrant or   visas, approved refugee applications, or lawful permanent residents under the executive order’s authority. The orders also do not   the suspended U. S. Refugee Admissions Program, nor do they prohibit other changes to U. S. immigration policy by either Congress or the president. The temporary rulings also mark the beginning of the legal battle over President Trump’s executive order instead of its conclusion. None of the judges addressed the broader legality or constitutionality of the order itself, instead leaving that to future court hearings where both sides can present more complete arguments to the court. In an unusual statement, the Department of Homeland Security said it would both “comply with judicial orders” and “implement President Trump’s executive orders” at the same time, noting that “less than 1 percent” of U. S.  travelers were “inconvenienced while enhanced security measures were implemented. ” The department also defended the executive order on its merits. “No foreign national in a foreign land, without ties to the United States, has any unfettered right to demand entry into the United States or to demand immigration benefits in the United States,” it concluded.');
INSERT INTO mytable(id,title,publication,author,date,year,month,url,content) VALUES (73802,'What Trump’s Executive Order Means for the Syrian Health Crisis','Atlantic','Olga Khazan','2017-01-29',2017.0,1.0,NULL,'This means the U. S. is effectively shutting out a group of people who are suffering from one of the worst humanitarian and   crises in recent memory. Syrians are living in medieval conditions, contracting diseases that had been long ago eliminated by vaccination, such as polio. Even highly treatable conditions like diabetes go unchecked, since the Syrian government and its allies have systematically targeted and killed nearly 700 Syrian doctors, according to Physicians for Human Rights. The five million Syrians who have managed to flee are mostly stuck in refugee camps in neighboring poor countries, such as Jordan and Lebanon, where medical care is also sparse. As Doctors Without Borders put it in a statement Saturday, “The president’s executive order will effectively keep people trapped in war zones, directly endangering their lives. ” For a closer look at the crisis and how Trump’s order will affect it, I spoke with Jason Cone, executive director of Doctors Without Borders —  U. S. The organization has set up clinics in refugee camps and, despite the threat of bombings and kidnappings, clandestine hospitals within Syria itself. An edited transcript of our conversation follows. Olga Khazan: What is the situation like for both internally and externally displaced Syrians, as far as their ability to get medical services? Jason Cone: We have five million Syrian refugees in the region. A roughly equivalent number are internally displaced in the country. For those still stuck in the country, their entire health system has been devastated. For the six years of the war, the health system has been targeted, doctors have been killed and tortured, hospitals have been bombed systematically throughout the war. There are few remaining doctors, there are hardly any left. Access to healthcare generally has been devastated. If you look at Syrians who had to flee the country, a place like Lebanon, one in four people in Lebanon are now a Syrian refugee. The health system cannot cope with that. That’s why my organization and others have had to open up medical programs in different parts of the country. Whether it’s for women to have a safe delivery, or whether it’s for someone who needs to restart diabetes treatment. We also have hospitals in Jordan, where one in 10 people are Syrian refugees. We opened up a   clinic because a lot of patients we’re seeing are suffering from complications from not managing their chronic diseases properly. They lost access to their normal prescriptions when they had to flee the country. All of this puts tremendous strain on the health systems of the countries that have hosted people. And then there are   injuries, which many people need extensive reconstructive surgeries if they survive. We have a trauma center in Jordan and a reconstructive surgery center in Oman, and those programs are running at mass capacity. It’s really a drop in the ocean as far as the need for people who have blast injuries, damage to their face, burn injuries. We run a hospital in Idlib, inside Syria, it’s an emergency hospital. It has 150 emergency cases a week, and 50 percent of those are burn injuries. Those people need skin grafts, they need rehab if their hands are burned. Khazan: What happens if I have diabetes and I’m in Syria right now? Cone: It’s incredibly limited access. Even if you’ve gotten out, it’s going to be a challenge. And managing diabetes, that’s also a lot about your lifestyle in terms of diet. If you’re in a refugee, you don’t have access to the kind of varied and healthy diet to manage something like that. Khazan: It seems to me like the U. S. was already not taking in very many Syrian refugees, even before this executive order. Cone: Canada has taken in far more Syrian refugees than the United States. It’s taking people one to two years to make it through the [U. S.] screening process. That speaks to the dubious nature of the executive order —  the system is quite robust and already very rigorous in terms of people screening before they make it through and get to be resettled. It’s not really the same as what happened with Cuba and the end of the Vietnam war, [as far as the U. S. taking in lots of refugees]. The acceptance of people is not commensurate with the scale of the crisis. What is the right number? It’s hard to say. It certainly it wasn’t enough before, and it’s definitely not now. The vast majority of refugees worldwide are hosted by neighboring countries, and those are some of the poorer countries in the world. They are really bearing the responsibility of the global crisis of forced displacement. The idea that richer countries or Western nations are the ones that are taking care of everyone, that’s just not the case at all. Khazan: One draft of the executive order included the idea of “safe zones” within Syria, though that was later excluded. Would something like that work? If not, why not? Cone: We’re talking about a conflict that involves dozens of armed groups, not even counting Russia, Turkey, Hezbollah, Iran, various Kurdish groups. Just the practicalities of doing something like that are daunting. And even if you were able to create a safe zone, you have to create the conditions to allow a sufficient amount of humanitarian aid to come, and there aren’t very many good precedents for that in this war. So why they would be feasible now remains to be seen. And also, frankly, people should be allowed to flee and seek sanctuary. They shouldn’t be forced to stay inside Syria. The health system is devastated, there’s very little aid, the infrastructure has been destroyed. People need to have some possibility of choice. Khazan: What types of treatable diseases are Syrians currently dying of? Cone: With [the   parasite] leishmaniasis, that has to do with the living conditions, without proper shelter, without access to clean water and soap. [Cases of leishmaniasis in Syria rose from 3, 000 before the war to more than 100, 000 in 2014.] Polio is something, the vaccination system and public health system has collapsed. You’re going to see children born who haven’t been vaccinated against polio, measles, tetanus. Once your health system collapses, diseases can come back because you lose herd immunity. And polio, as we’ve seen in Pakistan and Nigeria, when the vaccine campaigns aren’t happening, it’s a very resilient disease that can come back very quickly.   issues, like trauma, dominate. Doctors have to focus on the trauma and triage, and inevitably what happens is the health system is not capable of dealing with chronic conditions. You have to make choices with limited resources. Khazan: What about Syrian refugees in Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan? What are their medical needs? Cone: We run a clinic, a maternal and child health clinic, in Shatila refugee camp in Beirut, that predominantly serves a refugee population. We’ll be opening another hospital in the Bekaa Valley that’s focused on pediatric care and some reconstructive surgery as well. There’s nothing that tells us the conflict is going to end soon, and we’ll need to continue to support these health systems. Khazan: What are the obstacles, for MSF, to opening up more medical facilities inside Syria? Cone: We had five staff members kidnapped in January 2014 by the Islamic State. That’s prevented us from being able to negotiate access to any of the areas controlled by the Islamic State. We’ve tried to get access to areas controlled by the government, they have not accepted us. We’re basically running with national staff who have worked with us for many years. The normal way of us working, of having international teams, there’s no way to do that, because there’s no acceptance or trust of internationals. We’ve had to run clinics underground and bring in medical supplies and support a network of clinics. We’ve had to operate in a completely different model than we traditionally do in terms of negotiating our access. Khazan: What do you foresee being the   impacts on this generation of Syrians of not being able to get medical care? Cone: The one area  —   besides the immediate injuries that children might have received, like gunshot wounds, that they haven’t been able to get the right care for —  is the mental trauma from the conflict. You’re talking about millions of people who have experienced extreme mental trauma, and if we talk about not having sufficient health systems to care for their physical medical needs, there’s nowhere near the assistance that they’ll need to cope with trauma that’s  . That’s an experience that will be passed on for a long time.');

With thousands demonstrating boisterously outside the airport, the taxi lines normally packed with passengers inside the terminal were cordoned off entirely. And while none of the new arrivals at JFK had any luck hailing a yellow cab, the effects of the work stoppage were minimized in part by Uber, the   app, which continued to operate at the airport throughout the strike. “Customers took it as evidence the company was trying to profit off of striking workers,” noted Faiz Siddiqui of The Washington Post. Later, after the NYTWA’s work stoppage ended, Uber tweeted that it had turned off   at JFK, effectively undercutting taxi drivers as they returned to work after protesting. With airport demonstrations coalescing around the country, word about the controversy quickly spread and Uber found itself as an additional target of protest. Thousands of Uber users across social media vowed to never use the service again and posted screenshots of the app being deleted from their phones.   Uber, for its part, quickly tried to mitigate the damage. As the protests wrapped up, the company took the extraordinary step of clarifying that it had “not meant to break strike. ” Meanwhile, customers who deleted the app and cited its failure to stand in solidarity with the protesters received replies from the company asking users to reconsider. “We share your concern that this ban will impact many thousands of innocent people,” some responses read. “That’s why Uber is committed to financially compensating drivers affected by the ban, so that they can continue to support their families while they are prevented from returning to the U. S. ” Both the company’s tweet and its later response linked to a statement on Uber CEO Travis Kalanick’s Facebook page in which he spoke out against the ban and pledged to help its drivers abroad who might not be allowed back into the United States. But even this measure engendered more controversy, as Kalanick also added that he would try to continue his work with Trump as a member of his   group and seek to change the administration’s position on immigration from within. “[W]e’ve taken the view that in order to serve cities you need to give their citizens a voice, a seat at the table,” he wrote. In response, more Uber users, including several celebrities, publicly accused the company of collaborating with the Trump administration and promised to drop the app. Throughout this saga, Lyft, the   app that has proven to be Uber’s most formidable domestic competitor, simply sat back. Then, on Sunday morning, the company’s   John Zimmer and Logan Green released a statement that excoriated the president over his executive order. “Banning people of a particular faith or creed, race or identity, sexuality or ethnicity, from entering the U. S. is antithetical to both Lyft’s and our nation’s core values,” the statement read. “We stand firmly against these actions, and will not be silent on issues that threaten the values of our community. ” The letter ended with a   pledge to the ACLU. As news of Lyft’s donation made the rounds on Sunday, #DeleteUber continued to trend across social media.');

They abandon homes, jobs, friends, and family, because they are fleeing civil war, slaughter, hunger, and worse. Did those counseling the president —  men like Steve Bannon, Stephen Miller, and Michael Flynn —  give any thought to their plight? Did it not occur to them that there were already people with visas and green cards at airports across Europe and the Persian Gulf, or on planes heading to the United States when the president issued his order, people who are now being delayed, detained, or turned back? In retaliation to the bar on the entry of Iranians into the United States, Tehran announced on Saturday that it would likely limit the entry of Americans into Iran. Currently, there are several American dual nationals being held in prisons in Iran, on charges of espionage and undermining Iranian national security. This will make it much harder for the American relatives of these prisoners to advocate on their behalf. What happens if other Muslim countries follow the Iranian example? In the 37 years that I have lived in the United States, I have seen waves of refugees coming to America: Iranians fleeing the revolution in their country, Lebanese fleeing a murderous civil war, Iraqis seeking escape from war and destruction, Somalis, Eritreans, Ethiopians, and others. Even as a child growing up in Iran, I came to see America as a place of refuge for the oppressed. Among my mother’s friends were Europeans with relatives in America, including families of Jews who had fled the Nazis from Germany, Poland, and Hungary. As a university student in Austria in the 1950s, I came across the flood of refugees following the Hungarian uprising against Communist rule. Most of them made their way to the United States. As a journalist in Tehran in the 1960s, I knew of the Russian dissidents and Russian Jews whose departure from the Soviet Union for America was negotiated by the U. S. government. America secured the release of the famous Russian dissident Natan Sharansky. The   Amendment, passed by congress, facilitated the emigration of Jews who wished to leave the Soviet Union. Later, forced to leave Iran after the Islamic revolution, I accompanied my husband who was to teach at Princeton University. At Princeton, I became close friends with the   wife of a   economics professor. During World War II, when she was only 14, her family was deported from Poland, subjected to hard labor in Russia, then left at the Iranian border. They made their way to Britain, and, eventually, she made it to America. Despite the Iran hostage crisis, when 52 Americans, mostly diplomats, were held hostage by the country for 444 days, I and many other Iranians were nevertheless made to feel at home here. In 2007, when I was arrested in Iran and spent over 100 days in solitary confinement, it was in part the outpouring of American public support that secured my freedom. No one cared about my religion, beliefs, or original nationality. This is the America that became my home: a land where you were welcomed and treated fairly, where you could freely express your opinion and practice your religion, where the rule of law applied to everyone, not just the chosen few. Today, I keep wondering what is happening, what time we’re in, in this America. In my mind, I keep seeing the old German refugee couple in the film Casablanca, eagerly waiting for transport to America. In preparation, they are practicing their broken English. “What watch?” the husband asks his wife, wanting to know what time it is. We too may well ask: “What watch?” What time is it in our country?');

Cohen','2017-01-29',2017.0,1.0,NULL,'We were right. And friends who urged us to tone it down, to make our peace with him, to stop saying as loudly as we could “this is abnormal,” to accommodate him, to show loyalty to the Republican Party, to think that he and his advisers could be tamed, were wrong. In an epic week beginning with a dark and divisive inaugural speech, extraordinary attacks on a free press, a visit to the CIA that dishonored a monument to anonymous heroes who paid the ultimate price, and now an attempt to ban selected groups of Muslims (including interpreters who served with our forces in Iraq and those with green cards, though not those from countries with Trump hotels, or from really indispensable states like Saudi Arabia) he has lived down to expectations. Precisely because the problem is one of temperament and character, it will not get better. It will get worse, as power intoxicates Trump and those around him. It will probably end in calamity —  substantial domestic protest and violence, a breakdown of international economic relationships, the collapse of major alliances, or perhaps one or more new wars (even with China) on top of the ones we already have. It will not be surprising in the slightest if his term ends not in four or in eight years, but sooner, with impeachment or removal under the 25th Amendment. The sooner Americans get used to these likelihoods, the better. The question is, what should Americans do about it? To friends still thinking of serving as political appointees in this administration, beware: When you sell your soul to the Devil, he prefers to collect his purchase on the installment plan. Trump’s disregard for either Secretary of Defense Mattis or   Tillerson in his disastrous policy salvos this week, in favor of his White House advisers, tells you all you need to know about who is really in charge. To be associated with these people is going to be, for all but the strongest characters, an exercise in moral  . For the community of conservative thinkers and experts, and more importantly, conservative politicians, this is a testing time. Either you stand up for your principles and for what you know is decent behavior, or you go down, if not now, then years from now, as a coward or opportunist. Your reputation will never recover, nor should it. Rifts are opening up among friends that will not be healed. The conservative movement of Ronald Reagan and Jack Kemp, of William F. Buckley and Irving Kristol, was always heterogeneous, but it more or less hung together. No more. New currents of thought, new alliances, new political configurations will emerge. The biggest split will be between those who draw a line and the   —  whose longing to have access to power, or influence it, or indeed to wield it themselves —  causes them to fatally compromise their values. For many more it will be a split between those obsessed with anxiety, hatred, and resentment, and those who can hear Lincoln’s call to the better angels of our nature, whose America is not replete with carnage, but a city on a hill. This is one of those clarifying moments in American history, and like most such, it came upon us unawares, although historians in later years will be able to trace the deep and the contingent causes that brought us to this day. There is nothing to fear in this fact rather, patriots should embrace it. The story of the United States is, as Lincoln put it, a perpetual story of “a rebirth of freedom” and not just its inheritance from the founding generation. Some Americans can fight abuses of power and disastrous policies directly —  in courts, in congressional offices, in the press. But all can dedicate themselves to restoring the qualities upon which this republic, like all republics depends: on reverence for the truth on a sober patriotism grounded in duty, moderation, respect for law, commitment to tradition, knowledge of our history, and  . These are all the opposites of the qualities exhibited by this president and his advisers. Trump, in one spectacular week, has already shown himself one of the worst of our presidents, who has no regard for the truth (indeed a contempt for it) whose patriotism is a belligerent nationalism, whose prior public service lay in avoiding both the draft and taxes, who does not know the Constitution, does not read and therefore does not understand our history, and who, at his moment of greatest success, obsesses about approval ratings, how many people listened to him on the Mall, and enemies. He will do much more damage before he departs the scene, to become a subject of horrified wonder in our grandchildren’s history books. To repair the damage he will have done Americans must give particular care to how they educate their children, not only in love of country but in   not only in democratic processes but democratic values. Americans, in their own communities, can find common ground with those whom they have been accustomed to think of as political opponents. They can attempt to renew a political culture damaged by their decayed systems of civic education, and by the cynicism of their popular culture. There is in this week’s events the foretaste of things to come. We have yet to see what happens when Trump tries to use the Internal Revenue Service or the Federal Bureau of Investigation to destroy his opponents. He thinks he has succeeded in bullying companies, and he has no compunction about bullying individuals, including those with infinitely less power than himself. His advisers are already calling for journalists critical of the administration to be fired: Expect more efforts at personal retribution. He has demonstrated that he intends to govern by executive orders that will replace the laws passed by the people’s representatives. In the end, however, he will fail. He will fail because however shrewd his tactics are, his strategy is terrible —  The New York Times, the CIA, Mexican Americans, and all the others he has attacked are not going away. With every act he makes new enemies for himself and strengthens their commitment he has his followers, but he gains no new friends. He will fail because he cannot corrupt the courts, and because even the most timid senator sooner or later will say “enough. ” He will fail most of all because at the end of the day most Americans, including most of those who voted for him, are decent people who have no desire to live in an American version of Tayyip Erdogan’s Turkey, or Viktor Orban’s Hungary, or Vladimir Putin’s Russia. There was nothing unanticipated in this first disturbing week of the Trump administration. It will not get better. Americans should therefore steel themselves, and hold their representatives to account. Those in a position to take a stand should do so, and those who are not should lay the groundwork for a better day. There is nothing great about the America that Trump thinks he is going to make but in the end, it is the greatness of America that will stop him.');
